## A. Web track — substrate-adoption UX surface (post-2026-05-14)

The substrate work shipped 2026-05-14 (item-types, substrateMirror,
conflict-resolution `_v`, Solid-auth consolidation, sharing v2).
This list is the **app-level UX surface** that exposes those
capabilities to users.

| ID | Item | Source | Size | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | `'stale-peer'` event subscription on `bundle.pseudoPod` — auto-heal: publish local-fresher copy back via `notifyEnvelope.publish` for stale peers. `'concurrent-write'` affordance + UI banner deferred (lean: silent auto-heal only for V2.5) | functional-design §6a / coding-plan §"Standardisation adoption" | ~1 day | ✅ shipped 2026-05-14 — `wireSubstrateMirror` subscribes via `pseudoPod.on('stale-peer', ...)`, publishes back via `notifyEnvelope.publish({type:'request', ref, payload:event.localBytes, _v:event.localV, recipients:[event.fromActor]})`. 9/9 tests in `apps/stoop/test/staleAutoHeal.test.js`. |
| A2 | `groupCheck` wiring for `fetch-resource` (when Stoop adopts envelope-only mode). `substrateMirror` exposes `getPeers()`; wire that into a `groupCheck` callback. Currently full-payload, so this is **trigger-driven** — wait until bandwidth-tuning or cross-group fetch is a real concern | coding-plan §"Standardisation adoption" | ~0.5 day | deferred (trigger-driven) |
| A3 | Storage-policy picker in `/create-group.html` — four §II.2 policies (`no-pod` default / `centralised` / `decentralised` / `hybrid`). Wizard step copy + provider list when `centralised`/`hybrid` picks a fresh pod | functional-design §4a | ~1-2 days | ✅ shipped 2026-05-14 — `createGroupV2` accepts `storagePolicy`+`groupPodUri`, validates, persists in rules item + pushes to `bundle.podRouting.setCrewPolicy`. New `getCrewStoragePolicy` skill. UI: fieldset in `/create-group.html` with toggling pod-URI input. EN+NL locales. 12/12 tests in `apps/stoop/test/storagePolicy.test.js`. |
| A4 | `embeds: [{type, ref}, ...]` field on `postRequest` skill + embed-ref chip rendering on prikbord cards | functional-design §4b | ~1-2 days | ✅ shipped 2026-05-14 — `postRequest` accepts `embeds:[]`, validates (type+ref required, max 8), persists on `item.source.embeds`, broadcasts to peers via substrate-mirror payload. Receiver's `substrateMirror.mirror()` copies into mirrored item's `source.embeds`. Chip rendering in `web/app.js` via `renderEmbedChips`; CSS in `web/style.css`. 7/7 tests in `apps/stoop/test/embedsPost.test.js`. Click-through (Hub-mediated cross-app routing) deferred to P6. |
| A5 | `/group.html` storage-policy section + upgrade wizard (provision dedicated buurt pod / use admin's personal pod / point at existing pod) | functional-design §4c | ~1 day | ✅ shipped 2026-05-14 — new `setCrewStoragePolicy` skill (admin-only, one-way: rejects downgrade to no-pod once pod-having). `/group.html` storage-card with current policy display + upgrade row (hidden once pod-having). EN+NL locales. Covered by `storagePolicy.test.js`. |
| A6 | `/profile.html` "My Solid pods" section + two-pod upgrade preset | functional-design §4c | ~1 day | ✅ shipped 2026-05-14 (partial scope) — section displays pod-attach status (WebID + attached/detached) using existing `podSignInStatus` skill + sign-out via `signOutOfPod`. **Two-pod preset deferred to V3**: the substrate-side storage-mapping migration is V2-design-only (see `Substrates/storage-migration-design-2026-05-14.md`); the full editor lives in the Hub-web-console (post-P5). UI shows a disabled placeholder with the deferral note. EN+NL locales. |
| A7 | Agent-registry registration on bundle bring-up (Phase 52.10 / P5) — browser agent registers per-device under `pseudo-pod://<deviceId>/private/agent-registry` on first run | functional-design §6a | ~0.5 day | ✅ shipped 2026-05-14 — `attachSubstrateMirror` wires `createAgentRegistry({pseudoPod, deviceId: substrate.deviceId})` and registers the agent (idempotent CAS upsert). Opt-out via `agentRegistry: false`; capabilities/name customisable. Soft-fail: failures attach `null` rather than throwing. 6/6 tests in `apps/stoop/test/agentRegistryWiring.test.js`. |

**Total estimate:** ~5-7 days (A2 trigger-driven, excluded).

**Suggested order:** A7 → A1 → A4 → A3 → A5 → A6 (small foundational
pieces first; bigger UX surfaces second).

## B. Web track — V2.5 internal hardening (Phases 31-38)

Stoop-internal polish items deferred during V2 (Phases 0-22) and
recommended for V2.5. **Audit 2026-05-14: B1-B5 + B8 (Phase 39)
all shipped already** — 50/50 tests pass across the five phase
test files.

| ID | Phase | Item | Size | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| B1 | 32 | Deterministic stableId from mnemonic (HKDF-SHA256, salt `stoop-stableId-v1`) | ~1 day | ✅ shipped — verified 5/5 tests pass in `packages/core/test/identity/AgentIdentity.stableId.test.js` |
| B2 | 31 | Mid-flight identity swap on restore (`Agent.swapIdentity(newIdentity)`) | ~2 days | ✅ shipped — verified 9/9 tests pass in `apps/stoop/test/phase31.test.js`; `swapIdentity` at `packages/core/src/Agent.js:656` |
| B3 | 33 | Device-specific settings split (`shared.json` + `devices/<deviceId>.json`) | ~2 days | ✅ shipped — verified 10/10 tests pass in `apps/stoop/test/phase33.test.js` |
| B4 | 34 | `CachingDataSource.attachInner` bulk-sync of pre-attach local writes | ~1.5 days | ✅ shipped — verified 6/6 tests pass in `apps/stoop/test/phase34.test.js` |
| B5 | 35 | Auto-eviction enforcement (lives in `substrateMirror`-aware path post-2026-05-14 groupMirror retirement) | ~1.5 days | ✅ shipped — verified 8/8 tests pass in `apps/stoop/test/phase35.test.js` |
| B6 | 37 | Audit substrate (cornerstone for Hub Layers 2-4) | ~3-4 days | parked (Hub track) |
| B7 | 38 | Capability manifest + per-app pod namespaces; blocked-by B6 | ~2-3 days | parked (Hub track) |
| B8 | 39 | Picture attachments in posts and chat | ~2-3 days | ✅ shipped — verified 17/17 tests pass in `apps/stoop/test/phase39.test.js` |

Phase 36 (real OIDC against CSS fixture) is **deferred indefinitely**
per 2026-05-07 decision; not in this list.

**Remaining work in B-track:** none active. B6 + B7 parked.

## C. Mobile track — V4 web-mirror (deferred until web is further along)

Per user direction (2026-05-14): mobile work comes after web. Listed
here for completeness; not started yet.

| ID | Item | Source | Size | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | Phase 40.23 real-device pass + closed-beta APK (Hardware test, independent of substrate work, can ship anytime — user holds for hardware availability) | v4-mobile §6a | ~2-3 days | pending (hardware) |
| C2 | `'stale-peer'` event subscription on mobile (mirror of A1) | v4-mobile §6a | ~1 day | pending |
| C3 | Agent-registry registration on mobile bundle bring-up (mirror of A7) | v4-mobile §6a | ~0.5 day | pending |
| C4 | Crew-create wizard storage-policy step on mobile (mirror of A3) | v4-mobile §6a | ~1 day | pending |
| C5 | "My Solid pods" profile section + embed-ref slot on compose (mirror of A4/A6) | v4-mobile §6a | ~1 day | pending |

**Total estimate:** ~5-6 days. Picks up after A-track is mostly
done.

## Open questions before A-track starts

Captured here so they're not lost. Each blocks the relevant
A-track item; pin during that item's implementation.

- **A1** — How should `'stale-peer'` divergence surface to the
  user? Three options: (a) silent auto-republish (no UI); (b)
  banner on prikbord (`Concurrent edit detected — your version was
  newer`); (c) both. Lean: (a) for V2.5 (auto-heal); add (b) in V3
  only if real divergence is observed in field testing.
- **A3** — Default policy for new crews. The functional-design
  recommends `no-pod` (V1 parity). Worth re-confirming after
  testing the wizard UX.
- **A3/A5** — Storage-policy migration UX. Today's design says
  "upgrade only, no downgrade once pod-having." Should the wizard
  also surface a clear "this is one-way" warning? Lean: yes,
  explicit warning.
- **A4** — Embed-ref chip layout. Inline below post body or a
  separate "See also" row? Lean: inline chips below body (matches
  Folio note design).

## Out-of-scope for this TODO

- **P4 / P6 / P7 Hub track** — direction-only; design-mature;
  timing-deferred. Not Stoop-specific work.
- **V3 mobile design changes** — beyond C-track mirror, the V4
  mobile functional-design's "new V4" content is not yet planned
  for implementation.
- **Activities/hobbies app fork** (Stoop variant) — tracked
  separately in functional-design §9 Non-goals.
