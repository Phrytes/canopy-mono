/**
 * @canopy/sync-engine — pod ↔ external-source sync engine.
 *
 * Post-Phase 5.1 (2026-05-04): the V0 `SyncEngine` + `IngestQueueSource` +
 * `LocalFolderSource` + `InMemoryBackend` + `storageConvention` were
 * deleted as a parallel implementation of `core.DataSource` /
 * `core.PodStorageConvention`. The substrate now ships only the
 * Folio-lifted `SyncEngine` (formerly `BidirectionalSyncEngine`) +
 * the lifted helpers (`PathMap`, `scanLocal`, `scanPod`, `diff`,
 * `versions`, adapters).
 *
 * For one-shot ingest patterns (e.g. `apps/import-bridge-v0`), apps
 * write directly through any `core.DataSource` (e.g. `MemorySource` for
 * tests, `pod-client.PodClient`-wrapped for production). For
 * bidirectional sync (`apps/folio`), this `SyncEngine` is the engine.
 * For one-way live sync from a peer, use `core.protocol.LiveSyncSkill`.
