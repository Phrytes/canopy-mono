/**
 * SyncEngine — the heart of Folio's library.
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 *   - One-shot sync: scanLocal + scanPod + diff + apply (uploads, downloads,
 *     conflict markers).
 *   - Continuous sync: chokidar for FS events + interval polling for the pod.
 *   - State persistence: `.canopy/notes-sync-state.json` records the
 *     last-known-common sha256 per relPath, used by `diff` to disambiguate
 *     "local edited" vs "pod edited" vs "both edited".
 *   - Tombstone integration: SyncEngine.deleteLocal forwards to PodClient,
 *     so subsequent runs skip that URI.
 *
 * Design notes:
 *   - SyncEngine extends @canopy/core's `Emitter` so consumers (CLI, web
 *     UI, tray bar) can subscribe to `synced` / `conflict` / `error`.
 *   - FS events are coalesced with a 500ms debounce — a burst of edits in
 *     an editor's "atomic save" pattern triggers a single runOnce.
 *   - State is written atomically via tmp-then-rename.

   *        once the sha is unchanged for `stableMs` (default 250ms).
   *        After `maxStableWaitMs` (default 5000ms) the run fires anyway and
   *        a `'warning'` event with `phase: 'unstable-write'` is emitted.
   *
   *        Folio v2.10 copy-rename grace window: after the sha-stable check
   *        passes, wait an additional `graceMs` (default 3000ms) before

   *        Folio.C1 — hash adapter.  Defaults to a Node-backed
   *        `createHash('sha256')` wrapper.  RN callers pass an
   *        `expo-crypto` wrapper.
   * @param {import('./adapters/index.js').WatcherAdapter} [opts.watcherFactory]
   *        Folio.C1 — watcher adapter.  Defaults to a chokidar wrapper.
   *        RN callers pass an interval-poll watcher.  This is a SEPARATE
   *        knob from the legacy `watcher` parameter (above) which
   *        configures stability / grace timings.
   *
   * ─── V0.4 hook surface (Folio app-side concerns) ────────────────
   * Slice G #5 (2026-05-20) — substrate's app-glue seam.  Each hook
   * defaults to a no-op so non-Folio consumers (stoop-mobile, tasks-
   * mobile) work without configuration.  Folio's subclass pre-binds
   * its own implementations via `super({ ...hooks })`.
   *
   * @param {(localRel: string) => {sharer: string} | null} [opts.parseSharePath]
   *        Forwarded into the internal `PathMap`.  Recognizes a local
   *        relative path as belonging to a shared folder (e.g. Folio's
   *        `with-<webid>/<file>` convention) and returns `{sharer}` so
   *        the PathMap can route the file to the sharer's pod root
   *        rather than the local user's.  Returns `null` for paths
   *        outside any share folder.  Default: no-op (treats all paths
   *        as own-pod).
   *
   * @param {(args: {
   *   relPath: string,
   *   localBytes: Uint8Array,
   *   podBytes: Uint8Array,
   *   localEtag: string|null,
   *   podEtag: string|null,
   * }) => Promise<{merged: Uint8Array} | null>} [opts.applyConflictHook]
   *        Called when `runOnce` detects a divergent edit (different
   *        SHA on both sides since last sync).  Folio's hook writes
   *        a git-style `<<<<<<< MINE / ======= / >>>>>>> THEIRS` merge
   *        marker and returns the marked-up content as `merged`; the
   *        engine then writes that as the resolved file.  Return
   *        `null` to bypass merging (the substrate's default — emits
   *        a `conflict` event and leaves both copies for the
   *        caller).  Forward-additive: extra args may be added in
   *        future minor versions.
   *
   * @param {(args: {
   *   identity: import('./types.js').AgentIdentity | null,
   *   pathMap: PathMap,
   *   podClient: object,
   *   shares: Array<{relPath: string, sharer: string}>,
   * }) => Promise<{minted: number, renewed: number, errors: Error[]}>} [opts.ensureSharesHook]
   *        Called once per `runOnce` AFTER the diff is applied.  Folio
   *        uses this to mint / renew per-folder `PodCapabilityToken`s
   *        for any `with-<webid>/` folder discovered in this sync —
   *        the Q-Folio.3 auto-share convention.  Substrate's default
   *        is a no-op (returns `{minted: 0, renewed: 0, errors: []}`).
   *        Identity rotation: when `identity.pubKey` differs from a
   *        token's `issuer`, the hook should re-issue (see Folio's
   *        `autoShare.js`).
   *
   * @param {() => Promise<Array<{
   *   relPath: string, sharer: string, token: string, issuer: string,
   * }>>} [opts.listSharesHook]
   *        Returns the current share-token state for observability
   *        (the engine's `shares()` method delegates to this).  Folio
   *        reads its `.folio/shares.json` sidecar.  Default: returns
   *        `[]`.
