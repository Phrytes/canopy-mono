// canonicalShare.js — objective L: the REVOCABLE CANONICAL cross-circle share.
//
// The `canonical` sharePosture (alongside closed / copy / trusted / registered): expose a sealed item to a
// recipient OUTSIDE its origin circle WITHOUT copying it. The item stays CANONICAL in its origin circle —
// there is exactly one copy, in one place — and the recipient's access is a REVOCABLE KEY GRANT. The
// recipient reads the canonical resource (origin URI) IN PLACE through the shared-ref path.
//
// This is COMPOSITION, not new crypto. It reuses the same two substrates the household control-agent
// already stands on (controlAgent.js), but scoped to ONE resource and to OUTSIDE recipients rather than a
// whole container's membership:
//   • share  = grantMember(item's group-key resource, +recipient's sealing key)  [O(1) re-wrap, same version]
//              + sharing.grant({ resourceUri, agent, modes:['read'] })            [the ACP read grant]
//              ⇒ the recipient can unwrapGroupKey → openWithGroupKey the canonical item. NO copy is written
//                into the recipient circle.
//   • shareToPublishedKey (Phase 2) = the SAME grant, for a recipient OUTSIDE the origin circle whose sealing
//              key you do NOT hold from the roster. You source it from their PUBLISHED NETWORK IDENTITY (their
//              Ed25519 network public key) via `sealingPublicKeyFromNetworkKey` — the same ed2curve
//              Ed25519→Curve25519 map `AgentIdentity` already uses for nacl.box, wrapped into the envelope's
//              own X25519 SPKI DER. It is a KEY-SOURCING step, NOT a new cipher: the derived key flows through
//              the IDENTICAL grantMember/unwrapGroupKey/rotate primitives. The recipient opens in place by
//              deriving their sealing PRIVATE key from the same network identity (`sealingKeyPairFromNetworkKey`).
//   • revoke = drop the recipient from the roster,
//              rotateGroupKeyResource(new group key → the REMAINING recipients)   [forward secrecy, +version]
//              + sharing.revoke({ resourceUri, agent, modes:['read'] })           [ACP denies the resource]
//              ⇒ content sealed under the NEW group key can't be opened by the revoked recipient, and the
//                pod denies them the resource.
//
// The SHARING_GRANT_NOOP / SHARING_REVOKE_NOOP contract (sharing/index.js, hardened 2026-05-16) is
// respected transitively: `sharing.grant`/`sharing.revoke` THROW on a null/undefined SDK return (a no-op
// that changed nothing), so a share/revoke that didn't actually land propagates as a throw here — it is
// never mistaken for success. We do NOT swallow it.
//
// ── CAVEAT — the standard crypto-revocation limit (stated honestly) ─────────────────────────────────────
// Rotation revokes access to FUTURE content only: anything sealed under the NEW group key (re-sealed or
// newly written after the rotation) is unreadable to the revoked recipient. It CANNOT un-seal what the
// recipient already decrypted or cached before revocation — that plaintext is out of our hands. Revocation
// here means "no further access", not "un-see". A caller who needs the revoked recipient locked out of
// EXISTING content must RE-SEAL that content under the new group key after revoke (see `reseal` below).
//
// ── PHASE 3 — HISTORIC-KEY RETENTION (open across rotations) ─────────────────────────────────────────────
// Rotation now RETAINS the outgoing group-key version (groupKeyResource.js `history`), so a STILL-GRANTED
// recipient can open content sealed under an OLDER version they lived through — read the canonical item IN
// PLACE across rotations via `open(sealedText, readerPrivateKey)`. This does NOT weaken forward secrecy: each
// retained version's envelope only lets its OWN recipients unwrap its key, so a revoked recipient — absent
// from every post-revocation version — still cannot open content sealed after their removal. Retention only
// restores a current recipient's access to content that predates a rotation, never a revoked recipient's
// access to content that postdates their revocation. A freshly-granted OUT-OF-CIRCLE recipient still gets the
// CURRENT version only (grant carries history forward untouched) — never retroactive access to pre-grant
// history. Expanding that (grant historic versions) is a deliberate POLICY choice, not the default.
