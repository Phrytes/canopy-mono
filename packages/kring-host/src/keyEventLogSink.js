// keyEventLogSink.js — the no-pod DISTRIBUTION sink for a circle's group-key rotations.
//
// The control-agent (packages/pod-client/src/sealing/controlAgent.js) already emits the versioned group
// key AS a log key-event whenever it is handed a `keyEventLog` sink — on establish, grant, and rotation.
// This module is that sink for a LIVE circle: it is what turns "the mechanism exists" into "the mechanism
// fires on a real membership change". On every emitted key-event the sink
//   (1) records it in the local no-pod key-event log, so THIS device folds the new version into its own
//       key chain (the source content sealing reads with no pod), and
//   (2) FANS it to the circle's remaining members over the SAME peer channel content rides. The event is
//       sealed multi-recipient to the then-current members only, so a removed member — absent from the
//       event's `recipients` — never receives a version it can fold and cannot open post-removal content
//       (backward secrecy, no pod). The pod key resource is still written as defense-in-depth; the LOG is
//       the source for a no-pod circle.
//
// Environment-neutral by construction: the caller injects HOW to resolve the recipient members' peer
// addresses and HOW to send, so the web shell (circle roster via `listGroupMembers` + agent.sendPeerMessage)
// and the node harness (the member nodes + the same sendPeerMessage) share ONE fan implementation — the
// payload shape and the fan loop are defined here exactly once (no web/mobile/test drift).
