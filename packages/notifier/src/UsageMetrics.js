/**
 * UsageMetrics — local, in-memory counter for the push-UX feedback
 * loop and other "is this thing actually being used?" measurements.
 *
 * Lifted from `apps/stoop/src/lib/UsageMetrics.js` 2026-05-08
 * (Tasks V1 = rule-of-two consumer; the per-skill UsageMetrics
 * pattern was originally written for Stoop V1's closed-beta
 * runbook). Stoop's `lib/UsageMetrics.js` is now a re-export shim.
 *
 * Records per-event counts and the timestamp of the most recent
 * occurrence.  No persistence — apps that want metrics across
 * restarts snapshot to the pod on their own cadence.
 *
 * Apps interact via three methods only:
 *   - `record(name)`        — increment a counter, stamp lastAt.
 *   - `snapshot()`          — read-only POJO of all counters.
 *   - `reset(name?)`        — drop one counter or all.
 *
 * The whole point is the *discipline* of recording, not the
 * sophistication of the counter.
