/**
 * podRecovery — recover a circle's pod content by merging the LOCAL CACHES of a user's devices
 * (Objective S). Pure, no pod I/O.
 *
 * THE IDEA. Each of a user's devices keeps a LOCAL CACHE of a circle's pod content — concretely the set of
 * that circle's items held in the device's `CircleItemStore` (its DataSource: IDB on web, AsyncStorage/FS on
 * RN, memory in tests). If the pod is lost or corrupted, the content can be RECOVERED by merging those device
 * caches back into one consistent state. Because every device has been ingesting the same circle over the
 * causal-LWW inbound path, no single device is authoritative — the recovered state is the causal max over the
 * union of all caches.
 *
 * WHAT A "CACHE" IS HERE. One device's view of ONE circle's items, supplied as either:
 *   • an ARRAY of item objects (a snapshot already read out of the device), or
 *   • a STORE-LIKE with an async `list()` → the items (a `CircleItemStore` reads its DataSource for you).
 * A device that lacks an item simply doesn't contribute it — partial/missing caches are fine, and recovery
 * from a SUBSET of devices still yields the best-known state for the items that subset holds.
 *
 * THE MERGE — REUSE `causalWinner`, DON'T REINVENT. Union items across caches by `id`; on collision keep the
 * causal winner via `causalWinner(local, incoming)` from `causalMerge.js` (origin-`updatedAt` + writer-id
 * causal LWW). Consequences we get for free from that comparator:
 *   • a causally-OLDER copy never clobbers a newer one;
 *   • two truly-concurrent copies (equal `updatedAt`) resolve by the DETERMINISTIC writer-id tiebreak;
 *   • therefore the result is the SAME regardless of which caches are present or in what order they're read
 *     (fold of a total order over comparable clocks — order-independent).
 * Same caveat as `causalMerge`: a copy with no parseable `updatedAt` can't be causally ordered, so it falls
 * back to last-seen-wins for that id (order-dependent only among clockless copies) — items written by
 * `CircleItemStore` always carry `updatedAt`, so this is the pre-metadata edge, not the norm.
 *
 * PURITY + THE WRITE-BACK SEAM. `recoverCircleFromCaches` is PURE: it only reads caches and returns the merged
 * winners + stats; it performs NO pod I/O. Writing the recovered state to a FRESH pod is a separate, injected
 * seam — `writeRecoveredInto(targetStore, items)` — a thin loop of `targetStore.put(item, { origin: true })`
 * so the causal metadata (`updatedAt`/`updatedBy`) is PRESERVED on write-back and the store's own causal guard
 * still applies. Kept out of the pure core so recovery composition and its target are independent.
