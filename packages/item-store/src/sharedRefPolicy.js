/**
 * sharedRefPolicy — the injectable ENFORCEMENT surface for the cross-circle read (cluster K).
 *
 * `resolveSharedRef` (shareIntoAudience.js) resolves a `shared-ref` back to its source item — the read
 * that CROSSES circles. On the in-memory substrate that read is unguarded (there is no real pod to gate
 * against). On a real pod the source item lives behind ACP/WAC and, if confidential, inside a sealed
 * envelope. This module is the seam that lets `resolveSharedRef` ENFORCE that posture WITHOUT item-store
 * taking a hard dependency on `@onderling/pod-client`: the pod-layer surfaces (`client.sharing`, sealing
 * `open`) are INJECTED; this file only adapts their shapes to a tiny policy contract.
 *
 * The policy contract:
 *   {
 *     // Deny-by-default grant gate. Return truthy to allow the read; falsy/throw ⇒ resolveSharedRef → null.
 *     checkGrant?: ({ ref, recipient, stores }) => boolean | Promise<boolean>,
 *     // Transform the resolved source item → readable item (unseal). Return the item unchanged when
 *     //   there is nothing to open. Throw ⇒ deny (don't leak ciphertext).
 *     open?: (item, { ref, recipient }) => object | Promise<object>,
 *   }
 *
 * Two builders ship here:
 *   • makeSharedRefPolicy — pod-backed: verifies a real ACP/WAC read grant via an injected `sharing`
 *     surface (the `client.sharing.list` shape) and unseals via an injected `open` (the sealing/`open`
 *     shape). No import of pod-client — the surfaces are passed in.
 *   • makePosturePolicy — memory substrate: enforces the ALREADY-MODELED posture floor (the recipient
 *     circle's confidentiality must meet the ref's `posture`). Testable without a live pod.
 */

/**
 * The share postures the substrate recognizes — the confidentiality/exposure policy a circle applies when an
 * item is shared OUT of it (admin-set, per-circle). The first four are shipped:
 *   • `closed`     — external sharing off.
 *   • `copy`       — a fresh sealed COPY is written into the recipient circle (source untouched).
 *   • `trusted`    — copy mechanism; differs only in WHO MAY INITIATE (a member).
 *   • `registered` — copy mechanism; admins-only initiation.
 * and `canonical` is objective L (the deferred "revocable canonical"): NO copy — the item stays canonical in
 * its origin circle and the recipient gets a REVOCABLE KEY GRANT to open it IN PLACE (see
 * `@onderling/pod-client`'s `createCanonicalShare`: grantMember + ACP grant to share, rotateGroupKeyResource +
 * ACP revoke to deny). Enum-only here; the app's circle-policy mirrors this list for its settings surface.
