/**
 * @onderling/secure-agent — Phase-2 · Piece-2 (B2 wiring) integration test.
 *
 * Slice-1 gave the secure send path REAL failover, but on the live path it was
 * inert: the shared RoutingStrategy carried no PeerGraph, so `route → addressFor`
 * could not resolve a peer's transport-appropriate wire address, and there was
 * nothing proving that with BOTH tiers registered a peer reachable over only one
 * of them actually gets reached. This slice attaches a PeerGraph to the shared
 * router (`sa.attachPeerGraph`) and proves the previously-broken cases.
 *
 * REAL transport wiring — no bespoke mocks: each tier is a genuine
 * `InternalTransport` (a real core `Transport`) on its own `InternalBus`, so a
 * peer "reachable only over the relay tier" is modelled by putting the target on
 * the relay bus but NOT the nkn bus. Delivery is in-process microtask async —
 * deterministic, instant, no sockets/relay/network.
 *
 * Proven here:
 *   1. with BOTH tiers registered, `route(peer)` selects the higher-priority
 *      (relay) tier, the attached PeerGraph resolves per-transport addresses
 *      (B2 `addressesOf`), and a peer reachable ONLY over the relay bus is
 *      actually reached — the redeem-over-relay case that was broken;
 *   2. the control: with ONLY the nkn tier registered (the pre-slice-2 "relay
 *      is not a candidate" shape), that same relay-only peer is UNREACHABLE;
 *   3. a transport-class failure on the selected relay tier drives
 *      `onTransportFailure` → failover lands on the still-reachable nkn tier.
