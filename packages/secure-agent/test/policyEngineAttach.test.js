/**
 * A factory-built PolicyEngine must be ATTACHED to the agent — otherwise it is
 * a silent no-op that looks like enforcement.
 *
 * The bug (pre-fix): createSecureAgent built the PolicyEngine and exposed it as
 * `sa.policy`, and realAgent.js even wired `sa.policy.setRevocationCheck(...)` —
 * but `sa.agent.policyEngine` stayed null (Agent's field was getter-only, set at
 * construction, and the PE is built afterwards). So `runGatedSkill`'s
 * `if (agent.policyEngine)` was always false: nothing was ever gated. The fix
 * adds an attach-once setter on Agent and calls it in the factory.
