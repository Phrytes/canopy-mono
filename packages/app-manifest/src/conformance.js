/**
 * manifestConformance — the MANIFEST-CONFORMANCE STANDARD, in code.
 *
 * CLAUDE.md invariant #4: "the manifest is the source of truth for surfaces".
 * This helper answers one question for a single app manifest: *is this a
 * conformant manifest?* — i.e. does it satisfy the standard every real app
 * manifest in the monorepo holds to, such that a projector can turn its one
 * declaration into every surface without a per-shell escape hatch?
 *
 * It is the STANDARDISATION BACKBONE for the §6 "all surfaces manifest-driven"
 * arc: a reusable, package-level check (so it isn't re-implemented per app)
 * that the cross-app fitness test (`test/manifestConformance.test.js`) runs
 * against `apps/<app>/manifest.js`, failing CI on drift.
 *
 * DESIGN: only rules that are TRUE of every already-conformant app manifest
 * (tasks-v0 · stoop · household · calendar · folio · basis) are encoded
 * here — so the check is GREEN on master and RED on a real regression. Rules
 * the codebase does NOT hold to universally (registry-canonical `itemTypes`
 * under `strictNouns`, the `strict` skillId cross-check) are deliberately
 * NOT conformance failures: F-SP1-a permits app-local nouns, and some apps
 * legitimately reference external skills. Registry-noncanonical nouns are
 * surfaced as NON-BLOCKING `warnings` (informational), never flipping `ok`.
 *
 * Rules (each returns a coded issue — codes, not free strings, so callers can
 * assert on them):
 *
 *   1. invalid-structure  — `validateManifest(m).ok` is false. The structural
 *                           backbone: `app`/`itemTypes`/`operations` well-shaped,
 *                           every enum-valued field known, no duplicate ids, and
 *                           every `nouns` key ∈ `itemTypes`. One issue per
 *                           underlying validator error (carrying its path).
 *
 *   2. verb-not-atom      — atom discipline (B · Layer 1). Every `op.verb` must
 *                           be a known SDK atom/alias OR be declared in
 *                           `manifest.domainVerbs` (and a domainVerb must not
 *                           itself be an atom). This is the drift guard against
 *                           a new noun-specific verb sneaking in un-mapped.
 *
 *   3. nouns-required     — §1a noun-declaration discipline. A manifest with any
 *                           noun-bearing atom op (an atom verb naming an
 *                           item-type via `appliesTo.type` or a `type`-enum
 *                           param) MUST declare `nouns` — its member-facing
 *                           (verb × noun) capability surface is then the author's
 *                           explicit, written-down choice, not an implicit set
 *                           the gate derives (the #79 noise this arc removed).
 *
 *   4. nouns-vacuous      — §1a, the inverse. A manifest with NO noun-bearing
 *                           atom op must NOT declare a `nouns` block. This is the
 *                           #81 basis exemption made into a rule: the
 *                           shell/unifier manifest names no item noun, so an
 *                           empty `nouns:{}` would be worse than nothing — it
 *                           flips the manifest to declared-authoritative and a
 *                           future noun-op's capability would be silently dropped.
 *
 *   5. projector-error    — PROJECTOR TOTALITY, the direct reading of invariant
 *                           #4. Each surface projector (renderChat · renderSlash
 *                           · renderGate · renderWeb · renderMobile) must turn
 *                           this manifest into its surface without throwing. A
 *                           manifest that any projector chokes on is NOT a
 *                           single source of truth for surfaces. One issue per
 *                           failing projector (carrying the surface key).
