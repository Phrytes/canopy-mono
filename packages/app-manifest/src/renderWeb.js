/**
 * Render the web-surface projection of a manifest: a `NavModel`.
 *
 * NavModel is **platform-neutral** — the same data structure feeds
 * `renderMobile` (Slice C of `PLAN-gui-chat-uplift.md`).  The killer
 * cross-surface property:
 *
 *   ∀ manifest m.  renderWeb(m) ≡ renderMobile(m)  (as JSON)
 *
 * Equivalence is **strict by default** (owner direction 2026-05-20).
 * Per-field exceptions are allowed only on explicit owner approval,
 * with an inline comment explaining the deviation.  When an exception
 * is added, also update `DESIGN-navmodel-sketch.md` § "Adapter
 * equivalence test depth".
 *
 * Deterministic: outputs follow manifest declaration order
 * (sections from `manifest.views`, affordances/itemActions from
 * `manifest.operations`).  See "Owner decisions" below.
 *
 * ──── Owner decisions (locked 2026-05-20) ─────────────────────────
 *   . Detail-view: V0 = buttons-on-row only. No `section.detail`
 *       field yet.  V1 may add when user tests show drilldowns are
 *       needed.
 *   . Section ordering: preserve `manifest.views[]` declaration
 *       order.  Activity-based sort would shift sections around at
 *       runtime, which is jarring for users.  Matches `renderChat`
 *       discipline (also declaration-order).
 *   . Globals source: inferred from
 *       `op.surfaces.ui.placement === 'global'`.  No new
 *       `manifest.navigation` block needed; forward-additive.
 *   . Equivalence: strict JSON equality renderWeb≡renderMobile;
 *       owner-approved exceptions only.
 *   . Item sort: `view.sort = {by, direction}` passed through to
 *       `section.sort`.  Forward-additive.  Adapter performs the
 *       sort.  User-reordering (interactive) deferred to V1+ (needs
 *       item-store ordinal field).
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Phase boundary (PLAN guardrail): this package DECLARES.
 * `@onderling/interface-registry` runs per-type item rendering — once
 * mature, NavModel will reference `renderCompact` / `renderFull` for
 * per-item cells instead of returning `{text, buttons}`.  V0 stays
 * with the minimal {text, buttons} contract; adapters render the row.

 * Note on `callbackData`: the design sketch proposed a per-action

 * host when ≥2 apps composed).  Keeps NavModel pure-data.
 *
 * ──── — multi-type ops via type-enum fallback (locked 2026-05-20)
 *
 * Surfaced in A.2 by household's `addItem(type: shopping|errand|repair|
 * schedule, text)` — one chat-side tool, four web sections.  Three
 * surfacing rules:
 *
 *   (a) **`verb === 'add'` auto-surface.**  Add ops surface as section
 *       affordances without needing `surfaces.ui` to be declared.
 *       Rationale: every web section needs an "add new item"
 *       affordance; the manifest shouldn't have to repeat
 *       `surfaces.ui` for each.
 *   (b) **`verb === 'list'` skip.**  List ops are the section's
 *       implicit data source — adapter calls
 *       `listOpen({type: section.itemType, ...filter})` to fetch
 *       items.  Not a button.
 *   (c) **Other verbs require `surfaces.ui`** to surface as
 *       itemActions (state-gated per-item buttons).  Same as V0.
 *
 * ──── — `view.dataSource` explicit declaration (locked 2026-05-21)
 *
 * Surfaced by the CONVERGENT signal from B.2 (tasks-v0 mine.html) +
 * E.1 (stoop mine.html) + B.1 (tasks-v0 dag.html). rule (b) says
 * "list ops are the section's implicit data source — adapter calls
 * `listOpen({type, ...filter})`".  But many real sections need a
 * DIFFERENT list skill: `listMine`, `listMyMasteredTasks`,
 * `listClaimable`, `listMyRequests`, `getDagTree`.  Hard-coded in
 * adapters today; convergent signal = real substrate gap.
 *
 * Solution: `view.dataSource: {skillId, args?}` declares the skill
 * the adapter should call to populate the section, with optional
 * pre-filled args.  Forward-additive: absent → existing behaviour
 * (adapter calls `listOpen({type, ...filter})`).
 *
 * ──── — `view.readOnly: true` marker (locked 2026-05-21)
 *
 * Surfaced by A.3 agent's signal: household's `members` section is
 * empty by substrate default (no listOpen for contact) and has no
 * `registerName` affordance because `registerName` has no
 * `surfaces.ui`.  Adapter renders an empty "Add"-less section.
 *
 * Solution: `view.readOnly: true` → section gets `readOnly: true` +
 * affordances are skipped (creative verbs don't auto-surface in
 * read-only sections).  itemActions still render (state-gated per-
 * item buttons may still apply on read-only views — e.g. a "delete"
 * button on a read-only audit log).  Adapter can also use the
 * `section.readOnly` flag for visual cues.
 *
 * ──── — Creative verbs auto-surface (locked 2026-05-21)
 *
 * rule (a) said `verb === 'add'` auto-surfaces. Generalised: any
 * verb in the `CREATIVE_VERBS` set (`{add, register}`) auto-surfaces.
 * Surfaced by A.3 agent: household's `registerName` op (verb=
 * 'register', non-canonical via F-SP1-e) creates contact items but
 * has no `surfaces.ui` — under rule (a) it was omitted from
 * NavModel.  Now it auto-surfaces in the `members` section.
 *
 * Forward-additive: future creative verbs can be added to the
 * CREATIVE_VERBS set.  Keep the set tight — each addition expands
 * the auto-surface behaviour implicitly.
 *
 * ──── — `appliesTo.type: '*'` wildcard (locked 2026-05-21)
 *
 * Surfaced by E.1: stoop's `cancelRequest` spans all 3 prikbord
 * types (ask/offer/lend); `markReturned` only matches `lend` but
 * conceptually belongs on every per-row button. + F-SP3-a's
 * multi-type array helps but is manual per-op.
 *
 * Solution: `appliesTo: { type: '*' }` is permitted (validator).
 * Wildcard ops match EVERY view's section.  NavModel preserves the
 * `'*'` literal so adapters can decide rendering.
 *
 * Forward-additive: validator special-cases `'*'`; renderWeb's
 * `matchOp` returns matched=true for wildcard regardless of view.type.
 *
 * ──── — `view.dataSource.argsFromContext` (locked 2026-05-21)
 *
 * Surfaced by E.2 + E.3: stoop's privacy.html needs a runtime `lang`
 * arg (browser-derived) and stoop's settings.html surfaced the
 * adjacent need for context-bound args. `dataSource.args` is
 * static; runtime values forced consumers to bypass the manifest.
 *
 * Solution: `dataSource.argsFromContext: {lang: '$lang'}` — adapter
 * recognises `$<key>` strings and substitutes from the caller-
 * supplied `context` arg at call time.  Forward-additive — absent
 * means existing static-args behaviour.
 *
 * ──── — `view.shape: 'record'` (locked 2026-05-21)
 *
 * Surfaced by E.3: stoop's settings.html is a SINGLETON record
 * (`getSettings` returns `{settings: {...}}`), not a list.  NavModel
 * assumes sections are `Array<item>`. E.3 worked around by
 * treating the singleton as a 1-element list.
 *
 * Solution: `view.shape: 'record' | 'list'` (default `'list'` —
 * existing behaviour).  Adapter switches rendering: `'list'` →
 * iterate items[]; `'record'` → render the single returned record
 * with its fields. Future (deferred) lets the record's fields
 * declare their own patch-op for per-field mutations.
 *
 * ──── — `view.fields[].patch` per-field mutations (locked 2026-05-21)
 *
 * Surfaced by E.3 (signal #6).  Record-shape views (settings, profile)
 * have fields the user edits — but the current verb model has no slot
 * for "patch this field via opId(argName=value)".
 *
 * Solution: `view.fields: [{name, type, label?, choices?, patch?:
 * {opId, argName, argWrapper?}}]`.  Only meaningful when
 * `view.shape === 'record'`.  NavModel passes through to
 * `section.fields[]`.  Adapter renders each field as an input based on
 * `type`; on change, dispatches `patch.opId(<args>)` per.
 *
 * Forward-additive — absent means existing record-rendering (no
 * editable fields).
 *
 * ──── — `patch.argWrapper` for wrapped-patch shapes (locked 2026-05-22)
 *
 * Surfaced by the -adopt for stoop's settings (commit 9e7003b):
 * 's flat `{opId, argName}` assumes the dispatch shape
 * `opId({[argName]: newValue})`.  But many real APIs use nested patch
 * shapes — e.g. stoop's `updateSettings({patch: {pollIntervalMs: 30000}})`.
 * The page-level adapter wrapped this ad-hoc; makes it explicit
 * in the substrate.
 *
 * Solution: `patch.argWrapper?: string` opt-in.  When absent or empty,
 * dispatch stays FLAT: `opId({[argName]: newValue})` (behaviour
 * preserved).  When a non-empty string, dispatch is WRAPPED:
 * `opId({[argWrapper]: {[argName]: newValue}})`.
 *
 * Example (stoop settings):
 *   patch: { opId: 'updateSettings', argName: 'pollIntervalMs',
 *            argWrapper: 'patch' }
 *   → updateSettings({patch: {pollIntervalMs: newValue}})
 *
 * Forward-additive — absent means existing flat behaviour.
 *
 * ──── — `field.requiresField` conditional display (locked 2026-05-20)
 *
 * Surfaced by B.2.4 (tasks-v0 pod-settings): `groupPodUri` is only
 * meaningful when `policy ∈ {centralised, hybrid}` — the rich UI
 * hides the input when the policy is `personal`.  Auto-rendered
 * consumers would have no way to express that today; covered
 * the dispatch shape but not the visibility gate.
 *
 * Solution: `view.fields[].requiresField?: {<otherField>:
 * <value | value[]>}` — same shape as `appliesTo.state`.  Adapter
 * hides the field when the record's current value for any named gate
 * key doesn't match.  Multiple keys are AND-combined; a single key
 * with array-value is OR-combined within the key.
 *
 * Forward-additive — absent means "always show" (existing behaviour).
 *
 * ──── — `field.readSkill` for multi-skill records (locked 2026-05-20)
 *
 * Surfaced by E.4 (stoop profile): `holidayMode` is reachable two
 * ways — bulk via `getMyProfile()` (record-level dataSource) AND
 * dedicated `getHolidayMode` skill. has no slot for "this
 * field's current value comes from a different skill than the
 * record's bulk read."  Real consequence: refresh granularity falls
 * back to "re-fetch the whole record" even when a single-field skill
 * exists.
 *
 * Solution: `view.fields[].readSkill?: {skillId, args?}` — same shape
 * as `view.dataSource`.  When present, the adapter calls this skill
 * to resolve the field's value instead of reading from the record
 * payload.  Absent (default) → existing behaviour (read from
 * `record[name]`).
 *
 * Args are static at projection time (no `argsFromContext`
 * substitution yet; add when a real need surfaces).  Validator
 * enforces non-empty skillId + optional args object. -strict
 * mode cross-checks skillId against `operations[]` /
 * `externalSkills[]`.
 *
 * Forward-additive — adopting consumers add the field; non-adopting
 * consumers see absent readSkill and behave as before.
 *
 * ──── — `field.type: 'file' | 'image'` byte-shaped fields (locked 2026-05-20)
 *
 * 's recognized `field.type` set was implicit — manifests today use
 * `'string' | 'number' | 'boolean' | 'enum' | 'object'`.
 * formalises the set + adds two new values for byte-shaped fields
 * (avatar upload, document attach, photo capture):
 *
 *   `'file'`   — generic binary payload (PDF, archive, anything).
 *   `'image'`  — image-typed binary (preview-able, resize-able).
 *
 * Dispatch contract (consumer-side):
 *   Web — patch dispatcher receives a DOM `File` instance as the
 *         field's value.  Consumer is responsible for any client-side
 *         transform (resize, format conversion) before calling the
 *         skill.
 *   RN  — patch dispatcher receives the image picker's result object
 *         `{uri, name, type, size}` as the field's value.  Same
 *         consumer-side transform rule.
 *
 * The substrate stays renderer-agnostic — projector passes `type`
 * through verbatim; rendering + transform are consumer concerns.
 * Surfaced by E.4 (stoop profile.html's avatar upload — `avatarUrl`
 * is a data-URL post client-side resize; no type fit it before).
 *
 * Forward-additive — adopting consumers extend their renderer-side
 * field switch to handle the two new type values.
 *
 * ──── — `surfaces.ui.confirm` severity hint (locked 2026-05-20)
 *
 * Surfaced by the Tier C investigation (Project Files/Substrates/tier-c-proposals.md):
 * 14 destructive / side-effect-bearing surfaces across folio + tasks
 * + stoop already have hand-rolled confirm modals (folio's 3 custom
 * confirm modals + tasks-mobile's <ConfirmModal> + stoop's CLI
 * confirm() prompts).  Severity hints are a tiny manifest-level
 * field that unlocks consistent cross-platform UX.
 *
 * Shape:
 *   op.surfaces.ui.confirm?: {
 *     severity: 'info' | 'warn' | 'danger',
 *     message?: string,
 *   }
 *
 * Adapter styling:
 *   - `danger`  → red button + irreversible-warning copy
 *   - `warn`    → yellow button + side-effect-warning copy
 *   - `info`    → neutral button + informational copy
 *
 * The projector propagates `confirm` onto affordances + itemActions +
 * sectionActions (every surface where `label` flows).  Forward-
 * additive — absent means today's behaviour (plain click → action).
 *
 * Out of scope:
 *   - passphrase prompts (mnemonic / encryptedBackup) — auth flow
 *   - one-shot reveals (mnemonic show-once) — business rule
 *   localisation on message (use a future -style messageKey if needed)
 *
 * Adapters that don't understand `confirm` should fail the
 * affordance (strict) rather than silently ignore — a `danger` gate
 * dropped on the floor is a UX hazard.
 *
 * ──── — `labelKey` localisation passthrough (locked 2026-05-20)
 *
 * Surfaced by C.3 closeout: manifest `label` strings are English while
 * stoop is Dutch-first and tasks-mobile RN screens already use an localisation
 * function (`t(key, fallback)`).  Auto-rendered substrate UIs would
 * regress on localization.
 *
 * Solution: opt-in `surfaces.ui.labelKey?: string` on operations AND
 * `view.fields[].labelKey?: string` on record fields.  When present
 * (non-empty string), the projector passes it through alongside
 * `label`.  Consumers with an `t()` function resolve via the key;
 * consumers without one fall back to `label` (existing behaviour).
 *
 * Forward-additive — absent means existing English-label behaviour.
 * No adapter changes — pure consumer-side resolution.
 *
 * ──── — Section-scope CTAs via `surfaces.ui.placement: 'section-header'`
 *
 * Surfaced by B.2.3 deferral.  Inbox has a "Clear all" header CTA —
 * not creative (doesn't add items), not per-item. No slot in.
 *
 * Solution: ops with `surfaces.ui.placement: 'section-header'`
 * surface in `section.sectionActions[]` (parallel to `affordances[]`
 * and `itemActions[]`).  Same Affordance shape; the placement
 * difference is purely semantic — header CTAs are adjacent to the
 * section title.
 *
 * Forward-additive.
 *
 * ──── -strict — opt-in skillId cross-check (locked 2026-05-21)
 *
 * `validateManifest(manifest, {strict: true})` walks every
 * `view.dataSource.skillId` (also `view.fields[].patch.opId`) and
 * verifies it's either declared in `manifest.operations[].id` OR in
 * the new `manifest.externalSkills?: string[]` allow-list.  Default
 * (no `strict` opt) keeps the existing tolerant behaviour.
 *
 * ──── D / — `surfaces.page` projection (renderWeb tail, 2026-07)
 *
 * The renderWeb-tail slice of Objective D (all surfaces manifest-driven).
 * Ops that open a persistent rich-UI surface declare `surfaces.page`
 * (validated by: `{kind: 'side-panel'|'modal'|'screen', title?,
 * route?}`) — the Settings side-panel, the Cluster-C wizards (restore
 * identity, dispute, audience picker, encrypted backup, create/join
 * buurt), etc.  Before this slice, renderWeb DROPPED these declarations:
 * pages surfaced neither in the NavModel nor in renderCoverage's
 * web/mobile column, so the coverage snapshot under-counted the web
 * surface (invariant #4 honesty gap).
 *
 * Projection: each `surfaces.page` op becomes a `NavModel.pages[]` entry
 * (declaration order, deterministic).  Platform-neutral — `route` (the
 * mobile nav route) rides along so the SAME projection feeds
 * renderMobile; the web adapter ignores it.  renderWeb ≡ renderMobile
 * holds by construction (renderMobile re-exports renderWeb).
 *
 * Forward-additive: the `pages` KEY is omitted when a manifest declares
 * no page surface, so page-less manifests keep the exact
 * `{app, sections, globals}` shape.  renderCoverage's `screen` detector
 * now also counts `surfaces.page` (a page IS a web/mobile surface).
 *
 * ──── Nav-chrome — D / Surface 1: the top-level TAB BAR (2026-07)
 *
 * Objective D, Surface 1.  The four top-level tabs (screens · kringen ·
 * contacten · mij) were hardcoded IDENTICALLY in the web + mobile shells
 * (invariant #3 violated by construction — same ids + same locale keys in
 * two files).  Nav chrome becomes MANIFEST-DECLARED: a manifest declares a
 * `tabs[]` block of nav roots, and the shells project the bar from
 * `NavModel.tabs` instead of a per-shell `TABS` literal.  The four ids +
 * locale keys now live ONCE, in `manifest.tabs`.
 *
 * Each `manifest.tabs[]` entry → a `NavModel.tabs[]` NavItem (declaration
 * order, deterministic).  Shape: `{ id, labelKey, icon?, target }` where
 * `target` is the NavTarget union above.  Platform-neutral — the SAME
 * projection feeds renderMobile (renderMobile re-exports renderWeb), so
 * renderWeb ≡ renderMobile holds by construction.
 *
 * SIBLING KIND → `nav-actions` (Surface 2, now implemented).  The
 * detail action-bar (per-detail buttons) is a SIBLING nav-chrome kind: an
 * ordered list of the SAME `{ id, labelKey, icon?, target }` NavItem shape,
 * projected to `NavModel.actions[]` (or `navActions[]`) from a
 * `manifest.actions` block, validated by the SAME `validateNavItem` helper.
 * A nav-action's `target` is typically `{kind:'op', opId}` (invoke the op);
 * `{kind:'nav', to}` stays available for a "back to list" style action.  So
 * the reusable vocabulary is: (1) the NavItem entry shape, (2) the NavTarget
 * union, (3) `validateNavItem`.  nav-actions slots in as a second consumer
 * of all three — no shape churn on tabs.
