/**
 * NetworkTransport — inject-a-channel A2A transport across a network boundary.
 *
 * The #63 remote-handler tier (`@onderling/secure-agent/remoteHandlers`) proved
 * `agent.invoke(remoteAddress, skillId, parts)` routing to a truly-remote
 * agent's gated `callSkill` — but only over the in-process `InternalTransport`
 * (same-process A2A). This is the network tail: the SAME `agent.invoke` carried
 * over a genuine network channel to a remote agent, and the skill result
 * returned — WITHOUT weakening the capability gate.
 *
 * ── How it plugs into the port ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * It is a plain `Transport` subclass (the same port `InternalTransport` /
 * `RelayTransport` / `NknTransport` satisfy). It overrides only the one
 * required primitive, `_put(to, envelope)`, and drives inbound envelopes into
 * the inherited `_receive()`. Everything else — request/response correlation
 * (`_id`/`_re`), auto-ACK, SecurityLayer encrypt/decrypt, the `task` /
 * `task-result` wire payload shape — is the UNCHANGED kernel machinery
 * (`packages/core/src/protocol/taskExchange.js`, `Transport.js`). We invent no
 * parallel envelope: `agent.invoke` builds the exact same RQ `{ type:'task',
 * … }` it builds for every other transport; we just carry the bytes.
 *
 * ── The injected channel (hermetic; real sockets DEFERRED) ──────────────────
 * Following the established substrate convention (`@onderling/blob-gateway`,
 * `@onderling/confidential-llm`, `@onderling/data-connectors` — injected adapter,
 * mock-tested, real drivers deferred), the wire itself is INJECTED:
 *
 *   createNetworkTransport({ identity, send })
 *
 * `send(frameString)` is the ONLY thing that touches "the wire": it hands a
 * JSON string to some channel (a WebSocket, an HTTP POST, a relay). Inbound
 * frames are fed back with `transport.receiveFrame(frameString)`. A real
 * HTTP/WebSocket driver + DPoP-bound auth + a listening server are DEFERRED —
 * this module is proven end-to-end over a mock in-memory loopback channel and
 * never opens a real socket.
 *
 * Two shapes of channel are supported over the same code:
 *   1. Bidirectional / push (WebSocket-like): each side has a NetworkTransport;
 *      `send` delivers a frame to the peer, the peer feeds it to `receiveFrame`.
 *      Requests, responses and one-way task OWs all flow uniformly.
 *   2. Request/response (fetch/HTTP-like): the server decodes an inbound RQ
 *      frame with `handleNetworkRequest(transport, frame)` and gets back the
 *      correlated response frame to return as the HTTP body — no push channel
 *      needed for the common request→result case.
 *
 * ── The gate is NOT touched ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The capability token rides INSIDE the RQ payload, which SecurityLayer
 * encrypts wholesale into `payload._box` before it ever reaches `send`. On the
 * receiver the frame is decoded, decrypted, and driven through `_receive` →
 * the agent's normal dispatch → `handleTaskRequest` → `runGatedSkill` →
 * `PolicyEngine.checkInbound`. The gate is the only consumer of the token and
 * always runs. Serialization carries opaque ciphertext; it cannot smuggle a
 * token past the gate, and an ungranted / wrong-scope / revoked capability is
 * denied across the network exactly as in-process.
