/**
 * peerFacade — a pure, read-only projection that presents the three peer
 * stores as ONE per-(circle,member) `Peer` record, keyed by the member's
 * per-circle `circleAddress`.
 *
 * Connectivity Phase 4, Wave B (plans/DESIGN-connectivity-phase4-handshake-consistency.md §3,
 * governed by plans/NOTE-identity-and-linkability.md Decision A, 2026-07-22).
 *
 * Today the same peer's data is held three ways, keyed three ways:
 *   - the redemption trail / roster — keyed by `webid`, the SOURCE OF
 *     MEMBERSHIP; carries the per-circle crypto (`circleAddress`, signing
 *     `pubKey`, `sealingPublicKey`) + the disclosed `personaProperties`
 *     (see apps/stoop/src/lib/deriveRoster.js).
 *   - MemberMap — keyed by `webid`, the DISPLAY / identity-projection cache;
 *     carries `relation`, `trustLevel`, `nknAddr`, handle/displayName, etc.
 *     (see packages/identity-resolver/src/MemberMap.js).
 *   - PeerGraph — keyed by signing `pubKey`, the LIVENESS layer; carries
 *     `transports` (name → address), `reachable`, `tier`, `latency`
 *     (see ./PeerGraph.js).
 *
 * This projection LEFT-JOINS the trail (membership) with PeerGraph (liveness,
 * matched on the trail's `pubKey`) and MemberMap (display, matched on `webid`)
 * and returns, per member, ONE `Peer` keyed by the per-circle `circleAddress`.
 *
 * Per-circle by construction — the pinned model (Decision A):
 *   - There is NO global cross-circle id and NO cross-circle identity book.
 *     A member who is in circle X and circle Y yields TWO independent `Peer`
 *     records (different `circleAddress` each), computed from two separate
 *     trails. Sameness across circles exists ONLY when the joiner deliberately
 *     presented the same key at join — it is never manufactured here.
 *   - Keying by the per-circle address preserves the unlinkability spine
 *     (packages/core/src/identity/circleAddress.js) by construction, not by
 *     policy: the projection never introduces a correlatable cross-circle key.
 *
 * READ-ONLY. This does not change how any of the three stores are written;
 * it is a view the app reads THROUGH. No crypto, no I/O, fully synchronous.
 *
 * LAYERING (invariant 5, `apps → substrates → core`): this file lives in
 * `core` (alongside PeerGraph) and imports NOTHING from identity-resolver or
 * apps/stoop. The MemberMap list and the trail roster arrive as plain injected
 * arrays, so the projection can be imported by an app without an up-dependency.

/**
 * @typedef {object} Peer
 * @property {string}                  circleAddress  — THE id: the member's per-circle unlinkable address.
 * @property {string}                  webid          — the member's WebID (the trail's membership key).
 * @property {Record<string,string>}   transports     — transportName → wire address (flattened from PeerGraph; may be empty).
 * @property {string|null}             sealingKey     — the at-rest sealing public key (trail `sealingPublicKey`).
 * @property {boolean|null}            reachability    — PeerGraph liveness; null when the member has no PeerGraph record yet.
 * @property {string}                  relation       — 'group-member' | 'contact' | 'agent' (from MemberMap; default 'group-member').
 * @property {string|null}             trust          — network trust tier (PeerGraph `tier`), falling back to the per-contact `trustLevel`.
 * @property {object} revealState                      — the member's per-circle reveal-state: a `disclosure.js`
 *   policy (`{ perContext: { [circleId]: { key: {enabled,rung,matchable,requestable} } } }`), context = the
 *   circleId, default-withhold. The C7 reveal-state collapse (Wave B): the persona card reads this via
 *   `isDisclosed(peer.revealState, circleId, key)` instead of re-inferring from the raw `reveals[]`.

/**

 *   The SOURCE OF MEMBERSHIP + per-circle crypto. One entry per member.
 * @param {Array<object>} [o.memberMap]
 *   `MemberMap.list()` output — the display/identity cache, joined by `webid`.
 *   Display-only; never consulted for member existence.
 * @param {Array<object>} [o.peerGraph]
 *   `PeerGraph.all()` / `.export()` output — liveness records, joined by the
 *   trail member's signing `pubKey` (PeerGraph's primary key).
 * @param {string} [o.circleId]
 *   The circle this projection is for. The trail is already scoped to it (not
 *   used to filter — the trail is the membership authority); it IS the CONTEXT id
 *   under which each `Peer.revealState` disclosure policy is keyed.
 * @param {'open'|'pairwise'} [o.revealPolicy='pairwise']
 *   The circle's real-name reveal policy, an injected per-circle scalar (keeps the
 *   projection pure). Under `'open'` the circle discloses real names to members, so
 *   `revealState` marks `realName` enabled for every member; under `'pairwise'` a
 *   member's `realName` is enabled only when they've revealed it to ≥1 peer (the
 *   per-row `reveals[]` list). The per-PEER selection (revealed to whom) is not a
 *   per-circle bit and stays with the viewer/view-as gate, not here.
 * @returns {Peer[]} one `Peer` per trail member, keyed by `circleAddress`.
