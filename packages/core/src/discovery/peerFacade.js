/**
 * peerFacade — a pure, read-only projection that presents the three peer
 * stores as ONE per-(circle,member) `Peer` record, keyed by the member's
 * per-circle `circleAddress`.
 *
 * Connectivity Phase 4, Wave B (plans/DESIGN-connectivity-phase4-handshake-consistency.md §3,
 * governed by plans/NOTE-identity-and-linkability.md Decision A, 2026-07-22).
 *
 * Today the same peer's data is held three ways, keyed three ways:
 *   - the redemption trail / roster — keyed by `webid`, the SOURCE OF
 *     MEMBERSHIP; carries the per-circle crypto (`circleAddress`, signing
 *     `pubKey`, `sealingPublicKey`) + the disclosed `personaProperties`
 *     (see apps/stoop/src/lib/deriveRoster.js).
 *   - MemberMap — keyed by `webid`, the DISPLAY / identity-projection cache;
 *     carries `relation`, `trustLevel`, `nknAddr`, handle/displayName, etc.
 *     (see packages/identity-resolver/src/MemberMap.js).
 *   - PeerGraph — keyed by signing `pubKey`, the LIVENESS layer; carries
 *     `transports` (name → address), `reachable`, `tier`, `latency`
 *     (see ./PeerGraph.js).
 *
 * This projection LEFT-JOINS the trail (membership) with PeerGraph (liveness,
 * matched on the trail's `pubKey`) and MemberMap (display, matched on `webid`)
 * and returns, per member, ONE `Peer` keyed by the per-circle `circleAddress`.
 *
 * Per-circle by construction — the pinned model (Decision A):
 *   - There is NO global cross-circle id and NO cross-circle identity book.
 *     A member who is in circle X and circle Y yields TWO independent `Peer`
 *     records (different `circleAddress` each), computed from two separate
 *     trails. Sameness across circles exists ONLY when the joiner deliberately
 *     presented the same key at join — it is never manufactured here.
 *   - Keying by the per-circle address preserves the unlinkability spine
 *     (packages/core/src/identity/circleAddress.js) by construction, not by
 *     policy: the projection never introduces a correlatable cross-circle key.
 *
 * READ-ONLY. This does not change how any of the three stores are written;
 * it is a view the app reads THROUGH. No crypto, no I/O, fully synchronous.
 *
 * LAYERING (invariant 5, `apps → substrates → core`): this file lives in
 * `core` (alongside PeerGraph) and imports NOTHING from identity-resolver or
 * apps/stoop. The MemberMap list and the trail roster arrive as plain injected
 * arrays, so the projection can be imported by an app without an up-dependency.

/**
 * @typedef {object} Peer
 * @property {string}                  circleAddress  — THE id: the member's per-circle unlinkable address.
 * @property {string}                  webid          — the member's WebID (the trail's membership key).
 * @property {Record<string,string>}   transports     — transportName → wire address (flattened from PeerGraph; may be empty).
 * @property {string|null}             sealingKey     — the at-rest sealing public key (trail `sealingPublicKey`).
 * @property {boolean|null}            reachability    — PeerGraph liveness; null when the member has no PeerGraph record yet.
 * @property {string}                  relation       — 'group-member' | 'contact' | 'agent' (from MemberMap; default 'group-member').
 * @property {string|null}             trust          — network trust tier (PeerGraph `tier`), falling back to the per-contact `trustLevel`.
 * @property {string} [revealState]                   — reserved for the C7 reveal-state collapse (not populated in Wave B).
 * @property {Record<string,string>} [props]          — the coarse background values this member disclosed in THIS circle (`personaProperties`).
