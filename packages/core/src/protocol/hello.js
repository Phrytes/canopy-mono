/**
 * hello.js — bidirectional hello / key-exchange protocol.
 *
 * Purpose: let two agents introduce themselves without requiring pre-registration
 * via agent.addPeer(). After sendHello() resolves, the SecurityLayer on both
 * sides has the peer's pubKey registered and encrypted traffic can flow.
 *
 * Protocol:
 *   1. Alice calls sendHello(agent, bobAddress)
 *   2. Sends HI envelope: { pubKey, label?, ack: false }
 *      (HI is signed plaintext — SecurityLayer does not encrypt it)
 *   3. Bob's SecurityLayer auto-registers Alice's pubKey from the HI payload
 *   4. Agent._dispatch calls handleHello(agent, envelope)
 *   5. handleHello emits 'peer' on agent and sends HI back (ack: true)
 *   6. Alice's SecurityLayer receives Bob's HI, auto-registers Bob's pubKey
 *   7. sendHello() resolves (watches for 'peer' event for bobAddress)
 *
 * Both sides can initiate simultaneously without infinite loops because
 * ack:true responses are never re-responded-to.
