// Confidential-LLM route safety — the shared guard so no surface silently leaks
// raw, pre-consent / private plaintext to a host that can read it.
//
// THE RULE. Raw private text may only reach:
//   • a LOCAL model (on the user's own machine), or
//   • privatemode to a LOOPBACK proxy (co-located → the host IS the user's machine), or
//   • an ATTESTED enclave gateway (the client verified the TEE quote — "Option B").
// Anything else (a "confidential" route pointed at a plain remote host, or any other
// remote route) would expose plaintext to a host that can read it → refuse.
//
// This is the canonical home (SDK layer, @canopy/llm-client) so every consumer —
// canopy-chat circles, the feedback pipeline, third parties via the SDK — shares ONE
// definition instead of forking it. Browser-safe: `process.env` access is guarded.
//
// See the onderling-feedback repo: docs/CONFIDENTIAL-LLM-TRANSPORT.md for the model, and the
// "Option B" enclave-gateway build item (the real non-loopback production path).
