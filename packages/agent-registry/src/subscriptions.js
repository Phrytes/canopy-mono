/**
 * Community subscriptions — a user's subscribed communities → trust-graph roots
 * (commons-governance G3).
 *
 * The subscribe model, stated plainly: **joining a community = trusting its
 * curation.** A user keeps a simple, explicit list of the communities (circles)
 * they subscribe to. From that list two things are DERIVED for the G2
 * web-of-trust walk:
 *
 *   1. `roots()` — the union of the admin pubKeys of every subscribed
 *      community. These become the curator ROOTS (depth 0) the trust-graph walk
 *      starts from. Subscribe adds a community's admins; unsubscribe removes
 *      them. (Plus any `adoptedEndorsers` a forked community exposes — a fork's
 *      copied statements keep the SOURCE curator as `endorser`, so the source
 *      must be a root for D's subscribers to reach them. See communityCatalog
 *      `fork`.)
 *   2. `resolveEndorsements(pubKey)` — the per-endorser seam `walkTrustGraph`
 *      consumes: that pubKey's published `recommend`/`flag` records, unioned
 *      across every subscribed community's catalog resource, PLUS an optional
 *      `resolveEndorsements` fallback for endorsers whose records live in their
 *      OWN pod (transitive curators a community admin vouches for). The walk
 *      itself re-filters `endorser === pubKey` and re-verifies every edge, so a
 *      loose union here is safe.
 *
 * Wire `roots` + `resolveEndorsements` straight into `createCatalogSource`
 * (`roots` accepts a thunk, so subscribe/unsubscribe take effect live). This is
 * FEDERATION by construction: subscribing to two communities UNIONS their
 * catalogs; the bounded-depth WoT walk still applies WITHIN each community's
 * admin roots. The whole thing is advisory — the power-user override installs
 * off-catalog regardless — and exit is a right (unsubscribe, or fork + diverge).
