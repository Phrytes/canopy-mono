/**
 * @canopy/react-native/components — UI primitives shared across
 * mobile apps.
 *
 * Lifted from apps/stoop-mobile/src/components/* 2026-05-09 (Phase
 * 41.0.b B1–B4; Tasks-mobile is the second consumer).
 *
 * Components consume tokens via `useTheme()` from
 * `@canopy/react-native/theme`. Apps must wrap their tree in
 * `<ThemeProvider value={tokens}>` (or accept the substrate's
 * neutral defaults).
 *
 * The QrCodeView / MnemonicView land at their own subpaths
 * (`@canopy/react-native/qr/view` + `/mnemonic/view`) because
 * they're tied to specific feature substrates (Phase 41.0 L4 + L5).
