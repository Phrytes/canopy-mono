/**
 * Service.js — stoop's §1b op→atom adapter (PLAN-capability-arc §1b; mirrors the #65b household pilot).
 *
 * ── What this is (and what it is NOT) ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * This is the FUNCTIONALITY-side adapter that lets a caller invoke a stoop capability by its canonical
 * `(atom × noun)` pair instead of its bespoke op-id — the same seam `apps/basis/src/v2/householdApp.js`
 * opened for household. It is ADDITIVE: it wraps the EXISTING `buildSkills({...})` skill set unchanged and
 * routes `(atom, noun)` → opId → the real `defineSkill` handler. No skill, agent, or manifest is modified;
 * the legacy dispatch path (a `core.Agent` registering `buildSkills` and answering A2A task requests) stays
 * byte-identical.
 *
 * ── The DataPart wrapper (why stoop differs from household) ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * Household was already dissolved onto a per-circle `CircleItemStore`; its ops are pure functions over that
 * store. Stoop is NOT dissolved — it still uses legacy `@onderling/core` `defineSkill('opId', ({parts, from}) =>
 * ...)` handlers where structured args ride in a single `DataPart` (see `dataArgs(parts)` in
 * `src/skills/index.js`). So `callSkill` here builds the SYNTHETIC single-DataPart input the handlers expect:
 *   handler({ parts: [{ type: 'DataPart', data: {...args} }], from: ctx.by, envelope: ctx.envelope ?? {} })
 * `buildSkills` closes over ONE group's `ItemStore` + `groupId` (single-bundle mode — the same mode
 * `Agent.js` uses when `getBundle` is absent), so the store IS the scope: callSkill does NOT inject a
 * scope/group key into `data`. Ops that genuinely take a group (e.g. `leaveGroup({groupId})`) receive it as
 * an ordinary arg the caller passes, not as an injected scope.
 *
 * ── generic:{} is intentional — stoop has NO CircleItemStore ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * `dispatchCapability` is called with `generic: {}` (empty). Every declared stoop noun resolves to a
 * bespoke op via `resolveCapability` (bespoke-first), so the generic store-backed fallback must never fire;
 * an undeclared/unimplemented `(atom × noun)` correctly returns `{ok:false, code:'unimplemented'}`. (A
 * declared-but-op-less noun would return `{ok:false, code:'no-generic'}` here rather than silently
 * inventing CRUD — stoop has no generic store to serve it, by design.)
 *
 * ── SECURITY / gate guardrail (docs/architecture.md) ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `callSkill` is the default-deny security boundary. This adapter is therefore NOT to be wired as a live
 * `(atom, noun)` entry that BYPASSES the gate: the live interpreter path resolves `(atom, noun)` → opId at
 * the GATED basis waist (the capability gate authorises the pair BEFORE dispatch). This service exists
 * for tests + the future gated wiring — it hands the resolved opId to the real handler, it does not decide
 * authorisation.
