/**
 * deriveRoster — project a circle's membership FROM the durable, signed
 * redemption trail (the source of truth), left-joining the MemberMap for
 * optional DISPLAY fields only.
 *
 * Connectivity Phase 1, Part A (plans/DESIGN-connectivity-phase1-membership.md).
 * Fixes B1: `listGroupMembers` used to compute `MemberMap.list() ∩ trail`, and
 * the MemberMap is a lossy in-memory cache that reads EMPTY at runtime even
 * though the JOIN succeeded on the durable trail — so the roster (and the
 * fan-out recipients + mandate WIE that read it) went empty. This helper
 * INVERTS that: it starts from the trail and never lets the roster go empty
 * when the trail has members.
 *
 * The `membership-redemption` itemStore items carry, per member:
 *   { groupId, redeemedBy (webid), signingPublicKey, sealingPublicKey,
 *     circleAddress, personaProperties, confirmedBy?, channel?, redeemedAt }
 * — durable + signed + synced like any content (no pod required). Everything the
 * roster needs is already there:
 *   - `redeemedBy`  → a member (the joiner who presented the code, or a
 *                     mesh-introduced peer on `channel:'intro'`).
 *   - `confirmedBy` (on `channel:'peer'`) → the ADMIN, as recorded on the JOINER
 *                     side (the joiner's own trail never carries the admin's
 *                     `redeemedBy`, only `confirmedBy` — so this is how a joiner
 *                     sees the founder). Mirrors `listGroupRoster` (index.js).
 *
 * Founders never "redeem" their own circle, so the creator(s) are supplied
 * separately via `founderWebids` — derived durably from the circle's
 * `group-rules` author, plus (back-compat) any admin-role MemberMap entry. Their
 * role is forced to `admin`.
 *
 * The MemberMap is LEFT-JOINED for display fields (handle, displayName, avatar,
 * tags, …) and to backfill keys the trail happens to lack for a given row — it
 * is NEVER consulted for member EXISTENCE. Membership no longer depends on the
 * cache landing.
 *
 * @param {object} o
 * @param {Array<object>} [o.redemptions]         `membership-redemption` items for ONE group.
 * @param {Array<string>} [o.founderWebids]       webids to force role `admin` (creator + admins).
 * @param {Array<object>} [o.memberMapForDisplay] `MemberMap.list()` — display fields only.
 * @returns {Array<object>} one record per member, built from the trail + display left-join.
