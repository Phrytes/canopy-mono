/**
 * Fitness guard (#72, 2026-07-02) — stoop's B (verb × noun) capability surface must not
 * include its INTERNAL / view-shape itemTypes as member capabilities.
 *
 * `report`, `group-rules`, `rules-accept`, `group-leave` are manifest-shape requirements
 * (a `view.type` must be ∈ `itemTypes`, so these singletons/markers are declared) — NOT
 * content a member creates + manages. A `remove` capability on them is nonsense and clutters
 * the circle freedom matrix. It crept in via `cancelRequest`'s `appliesTo: {type: '*'}`
 * wildcard, which `opNouns` expands to EVERY itemType (same failure mode as canopy-chat #79).
 * Narrowing that appliesTo to the real content nouns removed the phantom rows; this test
 * bites if a future `'*'` (or an over-broad appliesTo) re-mints them.
