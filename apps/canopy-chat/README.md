# canopy-chat

> **Layer: app.** Command-first unified chat shell that consumes
> other canopy apps' manifests.  Static web deployable; mesh agent
> runs browser-side.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Status** | v0.1.0-dev (in progress — see `/Project Files/canopy-chat/coding-plan.md`) |
| **Companion docs** | [`/DESIGN-canopy-chat.md`](../../DESIGN-canopy-chat.md), [`/DESIGN-canopy-chat-journeys.md`](../../DESIGN-canopy-chat-journeys.md) |
| **Tier policy** | See [`/DESIGN-tier-policy.md`](../../DESIGN-tier-policy.md). canopy-chat pages are T1 (substrate-rendered by the chat shell itself) by definition. |

## What this app does

A single chat UI users open in a browser. Slash commands dispatch
to whichever canopy app owns the op (household, tasks-v0, stoop,
folio's pod-doable subset). User can spawn multiple threads, each
with its own event-filter + permission config.

Today the chat shell is **command-first** — slash grammar is the
deterministic dispatcher. A future v0.8 LLM layer translates
natural language into the same dispatch primitives.

## What this app is NOT

- Not an app substrate (does not own data; composes other apps'
  manifests at runtime).
- Not a replacement for apps' own web UIs — chat sits alongside
  the side-panel surfaces per [B.1 nav protocol](../../DESIGN-canopy-chat-journeys.md).
- Not a server — ships as a static web bundle.  Mesh agent runs
  browser-side via relay + NKN + WebRTC transports (per OQ-1.A in
  the coding plan).

## Substrates this app composes

Decisions documented after the v0.3.4 substrate-reuse audit (see
`Project Files/canopy-chat/coding-plan.md` § Substrate-reuse gate).

### Composed today

| Substrate | Used for |
|---|---|
| `@canopy/app-manifest` | App-manifest schema + `renderChat`/`renderWeb` projectors + `validateManifest` + paramsToJsonSchema.  Source of truth for Q28 reply-shape lookups. |
| `@canopy/manifest-host` | Runtime composition of N app-manifests.  `src/manifestMerge.js` is now a thin canopy-chat-shaped projection over `createManifestHost` (collision detection + Q28 reply-shape lookup all come from the substrate). |
| `@canopy/core` | `Agent`, `AgentIdentity`, `InternalBus`, `InternalTransport`, `DataPart` — wires the in-process two-agent topology in `src/web/realAgent.js`.  Browser-bundled per OQ-1.A. |
| `@canopy/vault` | `VaultMemory` for the in-browser AgentIdentity seed.  `VaultLocalStorage` / `VaultIndexedDB` are candidates when pod-sync lands in v0.6. |
| `@canopy/chat-nav` | Sibling substrate (this repo).  Implements the B.1 chat ⇄ side-panel navigation protocol.  Other apps' settings pages consume it; canopy-chat ships it. |

### Intentionally kept separate (with reasons)

| Substrate | Why canopy-chat does NOT compose it (yet) |
|---|---|
| `@canopy/web-adapter` | Adopted by tasks-v0 / household / tasks-mobile for NavModel → DOM section rendering.  canopy-chat's `domAdapter.js` / `domForm.js` are chat-specific (message-stream model, list-with-inline-keyboard, A2 lifecycle, record/mini-page with `[Close]`).  The substrate's `schemaToFormFields` overlaps with our `buildFormSpec`, but the manifest shapes are misaligned (its JSON-Schema vs our `op.params[]`).  **Revisit in v0.4+** when the manifest schema is next touched. |
| `@canopy/notifier` | Outbound scheduled push delivery + retry.  Our `EventRouter` is **inbound** event routing to threads.  Different concern.  When v0.5+ ships background notifications, notifier composes on top of EventRouter. |
| `@canopy/local-store` | `CachingDataSource` is for pod-synced item caches.  Our `IndexedDBStore` persists UI state (thread workspaces) without a pod inner DataSource.  **Revisit in v0.6** when OQ-3 pod-sync lands; the CachingDataSource shape may then be the right substrate. |
| `@canopy/chat-agent` | LLM-mediated chat with `MessagingBridge` + per-chat session manager + tool dispatcher.  canopy-chat is a **command-first** chat shell over manifest dispatch — different product.  May **compose** chat-agent in v0.5+ as an optional LLM-conversation sink alongside the slash path. |
| `@canopy/chat-p2p` | P2P chat envelopes via `agent.transport.sendOneWay`.  **Re-audited 2026-05-23 (v0.5.3):** canopy-chat does NOT compose chat-p2p directly.  Real cross-peer embed delivery rides on each HOSTING app's chat surface (e.g. stoop's `sendChatMessage` extended with an `embed` envelope field — app-side work).  canopy-chat's role: produce the envelope (Q29 + `buildEmbed`) + render it (`embed-card` shape).  The substrate doesn't fit our role; composing it would force canopy-chat to take on itemStore + identity-resolver + members machinery that belongs to apps. |
| `@canopy/agent-ui` | Out-of-process agent ↔ UI via HTTP+SSE.  canopy-chat uses in-process `InternalBus` (simpler; matches the static-web deployment of OQ-1.A).  Revisit if relay-bound agents land. |
| `@canopy/agent-provisioning` | Production-style facade (vault + OIDC + webid + transports).  `realAgent.js`'s manual wiring is intentionally minimal for the in-browser demo; the facade may replace it once OIDC handoff (J6, v0.6) is real. |

## Direct SDK use

`src/web/realAgent.js` imports `Agent`, `AgentIdentity`,
`InternalBus`, `InternalTransport`, `DataPart` from `@canopy/core`
+ `VaultMemory` from `@canopy/vault`.

Justification per `architectural-layering.md`: there is no substrate
that brings up a two-agent InternalBus topology pre-signed-in in the
browser (which is what canopy-chat v0.1's demo needs per OQ-1.A).
`@canopy/agent-provisioning` is the closest facade but it targets
single-agent production bring-up with OIDC + pod; canopy-chat's
"two agents on the same bus" demo isn't a fit until the
provisioning facade gains multi-agent helpers.

## Running locally

```bash
pnpm --filter @canopy-app/canopy-chat dev       # http://localhost:5173
pnpm --filter @canopy-app/canopy-chat build     # → dist/ (static-deployable)
pnpm --filter @canopy-app/canopy-chat preview   # preview the prod build
```

The dev server hot-reloads ESM. The mock household agent (v0.1.5
ships the real browser-bundled mesh agent) provides 3 chores you
can list with `/mine` and complete with `/done <name>` or via the
inline `[Mark done]` button.

## Conventions

This app follows:

- [`architectural-layering.md`](../../Project%20Files/conventions/architectural-layering.md) — substrate composition before reinvention
- [`app-readme-scheme.md`](../../Project%20Files/conventions/app-readme-scheme.md) (this file)
- [`single-agent.md`](../../Project%20Files/conventions/single-agent.md) — one
  `core.Agent` per service-context; per-thread state lives outside the agent
- [`localisation.md`](../../Project%20Files/conventions/localisation.md) —
  every user-facing string translatable from v0.1
- [`pod-independence.md`](../../Project%20Files/conventions/pod-independence.md) —
  v0.1 ships pod-less (local thread persistence in IndexedDB); pod sync is
  opt-in v0.6
- [`plan-tracking.md`](../../Project%20Files/conventions/plan-tracking.md) — the
  coding plan at `/Project Files/canopy-chat/coding-plan.md` includes a
  per-sub-slice **Substrate-reuse gate** (added 2026-05-22) so future phases
  audit existing substrates before writing new modules.
