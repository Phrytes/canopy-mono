/**
 * messageScope — whether a kring message is private to YOU or reaches the WHOLE
 * kring. A trust/privacy property of the message DATA (carried on the event), so
 * the interface is just one — swappable — presentation of it.
 *
 *   self   — private to you: a bot's info answer, a clarification, an error.
 *            Nobody else sees it (bot text replies are local, never fanned out).
 *   kring  — reaches every member: your own broadcast messages, and bot replies
 *            for an op that MUTATED shared kring state (a post, a task add/claim,
 *            an RSVP …) — the *effect* is shared even though the confirmation text
 *            is local. The marker reflects the true reach, not just "was this text
 *            sent to peers".
 *
 * The determination is a heuristic on the op's `verb` for now (read verbs →
 * self, mutating verbs → kring); a later refinement can let the manifest declare
 * an op's scope explicitly. Pure + shared web↔mobile.
