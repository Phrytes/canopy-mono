/**
 * circleShareEnforcement — the PLATFORM-NEUTRAL assembly of a circle's cross-circle SHARE enforcement binder
 * (cluster K · objective L). Both shells (web `circleApp.js`, mobile `circlePods.js`) resolve their platform
 * pod objects — the ACP `sharing` surface, the content seal `strategy`, the signed-in `podRoot`, the circle's
 * `controlAgent`, this device's per-circle `idKey` — and hand them here; this module composes the SAME
 * `makeCircleShareEnforcement` (+ best-effort `createCanonicalShare`) from them. Living once here is invariant
 * #1 (logic in shared src) / #2 (web≡mobile by construction): neither shell forks the assembly.
 *
 * It imports the substrate (`@canopy/item-store`, `@canopy/pod-client`, `@canopy/pod-onboarding`) but nothing
 * platform-specific (no DOM, no RN, no session objects) — those stay in the shells, which pass only plain deps.
 *
 * Returns the enforcement `{ onShare, onShareCanonical, revokeCanonical, onShareToPublishedKey, policy }` when the pod path is ACTIVE
 * (a signed-in `podRoot`, a real ACP `sharing` with grant+list, AND a resolved seal `strategy`); otherwise
 * null so the caller degrades to the in-memory `shared-ref` behaviour (no grant/seal/read-gate) — the additive
 * fallback both platforms share.
