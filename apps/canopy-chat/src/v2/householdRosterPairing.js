/**
 * canopy-chat v2 — household roster → no-pod sync pairing (OBJ-2).
 *
 * A circle's members are recorded as stoop `membership-redemption` items; `listGroupRoster` flattens
 * them to `[{addr, role}]`. To make a circle's items sync peer-to-peer with no pod, each device adds
 * every OTHER member's transport address as a household-sync peer (`agent.addHouseholdPeer`). When both
 * devices do this on circle-open (and after a join), they become mutual sync peers — so subsequent
 * writes fan out across the circle.
 *
 * Shared web + mobile (one source, each shell just passes its `agent`) — the structure invariant.
 *
 * @param {{ agent: object, circleId: string }} a
 * @returns {Promise<number>} how many peers were (re-)added (deduped by the agent).
