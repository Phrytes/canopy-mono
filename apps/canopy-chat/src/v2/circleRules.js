/**
 * canopy-chat v2 — circle rules document (shared, boards 3B/3C).
 *
 * A circle's governance, captured as a short document across seven aspects
 * (purpose / admins / agreements / conflict / admission / leaving /
 * responsibility). The create flow fills it via SIX plain-language
 * questions (responsibility folds into "agreements", so it isn't asked
 * separately but stays a field), and the join flow shows the assembled
 * document as an Agree / Decline consent screen. This module is the pure
 * model: field list, the question set, normalisation, build-from-answers,
 * and a completeness check over the required fields.
 *
 * Additive: the standalone editor + consent renderers ship now; threading
 * this into the existing createGroup/joinGroup wizard state machines is a
 * follow-on so those shared wizards stay stable.
