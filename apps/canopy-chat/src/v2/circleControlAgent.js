/**
 * circleControlAgent — compose a per-circle sealed-pod control agent (S4, pod
 * foundation; the SAFE offline-testable slice of REMAINING-WORK §4 E2).
 *
 * Wires the P3 sealing substrate into a single per-circle producer: a pod key
 * store (holds the versioned, recipient-wrapped group key) + a control agent that
 * grants/revokes pod ACL AND rotates the group key on membership change (forward
 * secrecy on leave). The `podClient` + `sharing` are INJECTED, so this is fully
 * unit-testable with an in-memory pod + mock sharing (no real Solid pod, no OIDC).
 *
 * Scope (deliberate): this constructs + drives the control agent and resolves the
 * content-sealing strategy; it does NOT yet restructure canopy-chat's single
 * shared stoop agent into per-circle agents, nor wire a real OIDC pod session —
 * those are the env-gated / restructuring phases that need a real pod to verify.
 * p0/p1 circles seal nothing → this returns `null` (the caller uses a plain client).

     * The group-key resource is the AUTHORISATION gate for BOTH sealed postures: a

     *   • p3 — RECIPIENT seal: content is sealed directly to the CURRENT roster's
     *          public keys (writer is host-blind) + opened with the member's own key.
     *          Recipients = every current member + the controller, taken from the
     *          control-agent roster so a p3 writer seals to exactly who can read.
     *
     * ── CROSS-VERSION READER (Phase 3, wired 2026-07-08 per Frits' call) ────────────
     * p2 content sealed under an OLDER key version (before a rotation the member lived
     * through) now opens too. The `readGroupKey` call above is the membership GATE — a
     * revoked/never member THROWS there, so DROP-OUTS get NO access, historic or
     * otherwise ("no historic access for drop-outs"). A CURRENT member then gets the
     * cross-version strategy over the retained key RESOURCE
     * (`resolveCircleStorage({ posture: 'p2', resource, privateKey })` →
     * `groupKeyStrategy({ resource, privateKey })`), which opens every version the member
     * can unwrap and seals under the current one — forward secrecy preserved (a drop-out
     * never reaches it). The access contract for revoked/never is UNCHANGED (still the
     * gate's throw), so gating on current membership adds historic-read WITHOUT flipping
     * the revoked/never security assertions.
