/**
 * circleMemberActors — resolve a circle's roster to media-grant ACTOR ids.
 *
 * The media blob ACL grants/reads on the capability-token SUBJECT, which is a
 * member's **signing** pubKey (`AgentIdentity.pubKey`) — see
 * `src/v2/circleMediaGateway.js` (remote mode grants `memberActors`) and
 * `@canopy/blob-gateway` (`capabilityVerifier` → `{ webId: subject }`, `podAcl`
 * matches `g.agent === webId`). So `memberActors` MUST be each member's signing
 * pubKey.
 *
 * The circle roster (`controlAgent.members()` / stoop `listGroupMembers`) carries
 * **sealing** keys + WebIDs — and sealing is a ONE-WAY ed2curve derivation of the
 * signing key (non-invertible), so the roster itself cannot yield it. The signing
 * key lives in the `MemberMap`: `members.resolveByWebid(webid).pubKey` — the SAME
 * resolution the kring/chat fan-out uses (`wireChat.send`'s `toPubKey`). We reuse
 * it here; no second source, no guessing.
 *
 * A member whose `pubKey` doesn't resolve (a code-redeemer before the redeem-time
 * signing-key capture, or before a card exchange) is DROPPED and counted — an
 * honest `unresolved` gap, never a fabricated actor. Those members simply can't
 * be granted media reads yet (they also can't receive fan-out today — same root
 * cause, same fix). NEVER pass a sealing key or a WebID as an actor: it would
 * grant the wrong id and every read would deny.
