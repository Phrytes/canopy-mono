// Shared locale blocks — the SINGLE source for keys both the web and mobile shells render, so they
// can't drift (the `circle.*` v2 surface used to be copy-pasted into both `locales/{en,nl}.json`, and
// drifted — `circle.bot.*` existed on mobile but not web → `/me` showed the raw key `circle.bot.failed`).
//
// Each shell merges these over its own platform-only keys: `{ ...appLocale, circle: sharedCircleLocale.<lng> }`.
// Leaves are the `{ text, doc }` shape (each shell's loader unwraps them). Add more shared blocks here
// (chat/common/reply/…) the same way as they get consolidated.
//
// A top-level block belongs here ONLY when it is byte-identical across both shells (union, 0 value
// conflicts) — the merge replaces the whole block, so a block with any platform-specific or differing
// leaf must stay per-shell. `consequence.*` + `role.*` joined `circle.*` (invariant #3 — finishing the
// consolidation `circle.*` started). Blocks that only partly overlap (e.g. a lone identical leaf inside
// an otherwise-divergent `chat`/`common`/`reply`) are deliberately NOT here — sharing them would need a
// nested merge or a key-path change, neither of which this shallow top-level-replacement mechanism does.
