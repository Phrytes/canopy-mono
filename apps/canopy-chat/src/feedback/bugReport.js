/**
 * Anonymous bug-report envelope — shared pure module (web ≡ mobile).
 *
 * ANONYMITY GUARANTEE (by construction): the envelope this builds carries NO identity.
 * There is no chatId, no participant pseudonym / agent public key, no webid, no handle,
 * and no device id — and no field through which any of those could ride. We read ONLY
 * the PII-safe on-device `records` (event codes + scalar counts, produced by the logger,
 * which is PII-safe BY CONSTRUCTION) and emit a fixed-shape literal `{ kind, at, app,
 * version, log, n }`. Because the output is a literal built from `formatLogs(records)`,
 * `records.length`, and the explicitly-named metadata, ANY extra keys on the inputs
 * (even an identity smuggled into a record or an extra arg) are ignored, never copied
 * through. This is the anonymous half of the "Report a problem" flow: the user reviews
 * the same PII-safe log, and only these fields ever leave the device.
 *
 * `at` is INJECTED (not read from Date.now() in here) so the envelope is deterministic
 * and testable; the caller passes the timestamp.
