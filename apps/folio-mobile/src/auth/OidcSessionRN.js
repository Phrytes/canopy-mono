/**
 * OidcSessionRN — re-export shim around `@canopy/oidc-session-rn`.
 *
 * **2026-05-08:** the implementation moved to the new
 * `@canopy/oidc-session-rn` substrate (Stoop V3 Phase 40.3 — rule
 * of two consumer). This file is now a thin shim so existing
 * `import { OidcSessionRN, SECURE_STORE_KEYS }` paths in
 * folio-mobile keep working without source changes elsewhere in the
 * app.
 *
 * The wrapped class pre-binds `appId: 'folio'` so the legacy
 * `folio-oidc-*` storage keys stay stable — existing user vaults
 * resolve unchanged.
