/**
 * buildFolioNodeSkills — the WIRE route for folio's NODE ops (Slice 1c,
 * follow-up to Slice 1b's `buildFolioSkills`; PLAN-folio-as-file-agent.md).
 *
 * The node sibling of `src/wireSkills.js#buildFolioSkills`: wraps each pure
 * core in `FOLIO_NODE_CORES` with `wireSkill(coreFn, op, { storeFor })`, so the
 * folioManifest op stays the single contract and the `defineSkill`-shaped
 * handler is DERIVED from it, not hand-rolled.  The set is manifest-derived:
 * EVERY folioManifest op tagged `runtime:'node'` (the local-SyncEngine control
 * surface — `syncOnce` / `watchStart` / `watchStop` / `forceRepush` /
 * `deleteLocally`) must have a core, and every node core must map to such an op
 * — the node fitness test fails CI otherwise.
 *
 * WHERE THIS IS WIRED (mirrors the Slice-1b precedent, `registerFolioAgent.js`):
 * folio has NO long-lived node-side `core.Agent` process today — the HTTP
 * server (`src/server/routes.js`) + the CLI own these ops directly.  So, exactly
 * like the browser side EXPOSES `buildFolioSkills` + `registerFolioAgent` for
 * the consuming composition (canopy-chat's browser agent boot) rather than
 * spinning up its own agent, this module EXPOSES `buildFolioNodeSkills` for the
 * eventual node composition (a `folio serve` agent, or a host chat agent that
 * embeds folio) to register on its agent once it has a live SyncEngine.  A new
 * long-lived agent is deliberately NOT invented here.
 *
 * SEPARATE FILE (not folded into `wireSkills.js`) so `browser.js` — which
 * imports `wireSkills.js` — never pulls the node core module into its module
 * graph, keeping the browser bundle engine-free by construction.
 *
 * RESOLUTION / BROWSER-BOUNDARY: `wireSkill` is imported by RELATIVE PATH from
 * `@canopy/sdk`'s source (not the bare barrel, which re-exports node transports)
 * — the SAME rationale + path as `src/wireSkills.js`.  `wireSkill.js` + its only
 * import `connectSkill.js` are a zero-dependency, node-free 2-file closure, and
 * folio's isolated `node_modules` has no `@canopy/sdk`.
