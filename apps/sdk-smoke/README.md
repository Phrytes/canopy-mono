# sdk-smoke — two-device SDK smoke harness

> **Layer: app.** Composes substrates from `packages/{item-store, agent-ui, ...}`. Direct kernel use is allowed only when justified in this README's `## Direct kernel use` section (per [`app-readme-scheme.md`](../../docs/conventions/app-readme-scheme.md)). See [`Project Files/conventions/architectural-layering.md`](../../docs/conventions/architectural-layering.md). **Known direct kernel use:** by design — sdk-smoke's purpose is validating kernel + adapter primitives (`@canopy/core`, `@canopy/relay`, `@canopy/react-native`) on real hardware, so it consumes the kernel + adapters directly.

A stripped-down Expo app that exposes each kernel/adapter area as a press-button
test, used to validate that Tracks A–G survive on real hardware.

This app is **not** an end-user demo — it has no chat UI, no Folio, no styling
beyond what's needed to read a status pill.  See
`../../coding-plans/sdk-two-device-smoke.md`
for the full plan, the 10 scenarios (S1–S10), and the bring-up runbook.

## Substrates

*None.* By design — see "Direct kernel use" below.

`sdk-smoke` exists to validate the kernel + adapters (Tracks A–G) on real hardware. Composing substrates here would defeat the purpose: it would mean the harness depended on the very abstractions the substrates layer wraps, hiding regressions in the kernel + adapters from the smoke run. The exemption is explicitly noted in the architectural-layering doc.

## Direct kernel use

| Kernel/adapter package | Primitive | Used for | Justification |
|---|---|---|---|
| `@canopy/core` | `Agent`, `AgentIdentity`, `Bootstrap`, `RelayTransport`, `RendezvousTransport`, `OfflineTransport`, `defineSkill`, capability tokens, A2A bridge | Each scenario (S1–S10) exercises a different kernel/adapter area: bootstrap, vault migration, pod sync, capability share, identity rotation, governance, skills-pubsub, A2A-sealed, battery-sleep, etc. | This is the harness whose entire purpose is exercising the kernel + adapters directly — the architectural-layering doc lists `sdk-smoke` as the canonical exemption. Substrate composition would defeat the point. |
| `@canopy/relay` | `RelayTransport` (client side), token register | Real-relay validation: scenarios that need a remote peer use the relay for connection. | Same as above — the relay is the transport adapter whose hardware behavior is under test. |
| `@canopy/react-native` | `KeychainVault`, `MdnsTransport`, `BleTransport`, `MobilePushBridge`, `ExpoNotificationsAdapter`, `createMeshAgent`, `requestMeshPermissions`, `platform/polyfills` | RN platform layer — every scenario runs on a real device, so RN-specific bring-up is exercised end-to-end. | Same as above. |
| `@canopy/pod-client` | `PodClient` | Pod-sync scenarios (S3, S4) write/read against a real Solid pod. | Same as above. |

Each scenario file exports `{ id, title, run({ log, sdk }) }`.  The contract:

```js
export async function run({ log, sdk }) {
  log('S1: starting…');
  // ... do the SDK work ...
  return { status: 'pass' | 'fail' | 'pending' | 'degraded', detail: '...', durationMs };
}
```

Today every `run()` is a stub that returns `pending`.  Each scenario's logic
gets filled in **as it's actually run** on two devices — this is intentional;
the task is to give the harness a runnable shape now and to flesh in scenarios
during the hands-on session.

## Bring it up

> Before any of these commands, make sure the relay is running on the laptop
> with verbose logging:
>
> ```bash
> RELAY_VERBOSE=1 npm run relay:start
> ```

### On an Android emulator

1. Start an Android emulator (Pixel 6 / API 34 / x86_64 is known good — see
   the bring-up runbook in `coding-plans/sdk-two-device-smoke.md` for the AVD
   setup).
2. From `apps/sdk-smoke/`:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npx expo start --android
   ```
3. The emulator picks up Metro automatically; the app loads as a dev client
   build.  If Metro can't see the laptop's relay over the emulator loopback,
   set `RELAY_URL` in `src/lib/config.js` to `ws://10.0.2.2:8787`.

### On a real Android phone (USB or LAN)

1. **First time only:** build a dev client and sideload it.
   ```bash
   eas build --profile development --platform android
   ```
   Sideload the resulting `.apk` to the phone.
2. From `apps/sdk-smoke/`:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npx expo start
   ```
   Press `a` in the Metro CLI (or scan the QR) to attach the device.

> **Do NOT run `npx expo run:android`.**  Phone-A's existing mesh-demo dev
> build (CLAUDE.md gotcha) is at `com.canopy.meshdemo`, distinct from
> sdk-smoke's `ag.canopy.sdksmoke`.  `expo run:android` will install the
> wrong target onto the wrong build slot.  Stick to `expo start` + sideloaded
> dev client.

### On an iPhone

iOS is **deferred** per Q-Smoke.1 (locked 2026-04-29).  This README will be
updated when iOS coverage is on the table.

## Reading the harness

- Each row shows `id` + `title` + a status pill.  Statuses: `pending`,
  `running`, `pass`, `fail`, `degraded`.
- Press **Run** to fire the scenario.  Press **Show log** to expand the
  scrollable log pane underneath.
- The log pane is monospace and selectable so you can copy lines into the
  results doc.
- The harness pre-warms one shared agent on first **Run** (or on **Init
  agent** in the header).  All scenarios share that agent — there's only one
  Keychain row set per app session.

## Pairing with the relay's verbose log

When `RELAY_VERBOSE=1` is set on the relay, every hop appears as
`[verbose] <senderShort> → <recvShort> bytes=N type=<_p>`.  The leak
detector adds a `[verbose] potential plaintext leak: ...` line for any
forwarded envelope whose body looks like 20+ readable UTF-8 characters in
a row — this is the on-the-wire check S9 needs.

To pair a harness log with relay output, line the log pane and the relay
stdout up by wall-clock timestamp (the LogPane prints `hh:mm:ss.mmm` on every
line).

## Tests

This app has no unit tests today — its purpose is hands-on validation.  The
scenario stubs themselves return structured results so they're easy to
integrate into a test runner later if needed.
