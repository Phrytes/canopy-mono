/**
 * Playwright config for basis browser-driven tests.
 *
 * Boots `pnpm dev` on a known port, then drives two browser
 * contexts so we can headlessly verify the things that Vitest
 * can't reach: real DOM rendering, IndexedDB persistence under
 * a Chromium runtime, multi-tab cross-peer flows (sender Tab A,
 * receiver Tab B).
 *
 * Note: this config + the example test (test-browser/) are scaffold
 * only.  To USE them you must first install Playwright from the
 * repo root:
 *
 *   cd /home/frits/expotest/canopy-mono
 *   pnpm add -Dw @playwright/test playwright
 *   pnpm exec playwright install chromium
 *
 * Then run from this app:
 *
 *   pnpm --filter basis exec playwright test
 *
 * The browser-driven tests live in `test-browser/` (separate from
 * `test/` so Vitest doesn't pick them up — Playwright + Vitest have
 * incompatible runners).

/* The connectivity SETUP/MODE MATRIX (test-browser/setups.js + matrix.spec.js) adds a small set of
 * transport-dimension PROJECTS so a reviewer can run one setup:
 *   --project=chromium  the existing default (NKN, no relay env) — unchanged.
 *   --project=nkn       the NKN transport setup explicitly (alias of the default transport).
 *   --project=relay     the relay transport setup. Bring up a local @onderling/relay by ARMING the
 *                       fixture with PEER_TEST_RELAY (a ws:// URL); globalSetup starts it, the harness
 *                       seeds it per-client (localStorage cc.relayUrl + ?relay=), globalTeardown kills it:
 *                         PEER_TEST_RELAY=ws://127.0.0.1:8787 npx playwright test --project=relay
