/**
 * Playwright config for basis browser-driven tests.
 *
 * Boots `pnpm dev` on a known port, then drives two browser
 * contexts so we can headlessly verify the things that Vitest
 * can't reach: real DOM rendering, IndexedDB persistence under
 * a Chromium runtime, multi-tab cross-peer flows (sender Tab A,
 * receiver Tab B).
 *
 * Note: this config + the example test (test-browser/) are scaffold
 * only.  To USE them you must first install Playwright from the
 * repo root:
 *
 *   cd /home/frits/expotest/canopy-mono
 *   pnpm add -Dw @playwright/test playwright
 *   pnpm exec playwright install chromium
 *
 * Then run from this app:
 *
 *   pnpm --filter basis exec playwright test
 *
 * The browser-driven tests live in `test-browser/` (separate from
 * `test/` so Vitest doesn't pick them up — Playwright + Vitest have
 * incompatible runners).
