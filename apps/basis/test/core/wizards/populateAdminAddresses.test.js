/**
 * Connectivity Phase-2 · slice 2b (population) — unit proof.
 *
 * Slice 2 attached the app's PeerGraph to the shared secure router so
 * `route → addressFor → PeerGraph.addressesOf` COULD resolve a peer's
 * per-transport wire address — but nothing populated the graph, so on the
 * real join path `addressesOf(adminPubKey)` returned nothing and the redeem
 * degraded to (and failed over) NKN.
 *
 * This proves the population helper closes that gap end-to-end at the unit
 * level: an invite carrying the admin's `adminPeerAddr` (the pubKey = relay
 * wire address) + `adminNknAddr` (the NKN native address), once decoded and
 * fed through `populateAdminAddressesFromInvite`, makes a REAL PeerGraph
 * resolve BOTH addresses for the admin's canonical id — no mocks, the actual
 * `@onderling/core` PeerGraph.
