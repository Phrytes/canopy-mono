/**
 * basis — the LIVE no-pod group-key rotation: driven by the REAL `removeMember` op, not a harness stand-in.
 *
 * `appNoPodKeyRotation.test.js` proves the MECHANISM (key-events in the log) by calling the key-event
 * builders directly via the harness's `removeAndRotate`. This test proves the WIRING: that removing a member
 * through the production op path actually FIRES that mechanism. The path exercised end-to-end is
 *
 *   admin.callSkill('stoop','removeMember')  →  stoop removeMember skill (revokePodAccess)
 *     →  the per-circle control-agent ROUTER (stoopControlAgent)
 *       →  the circle producer's control agent (createControlAgent.removeMember → emitKeyEvent)
 *         →  the injected keyEventLog SINK  →  records the admin's copy + FANS the rotation key-event
 *            to the REMAINING members only, over the real InternalBus transport.
 *
 * No stand-in on the remove path. The producer + sink are the SAME `createCirclePodProducer` +
 * `makeKeyEventLogSink` the web shell (circleApp.js) wires; the harness only supplies node equivalents of
 * the transport addressing (member nodes) and the in-memory pod — exactly the seams the browser supplies too.
 *
 * Asserts, over THREE real agents on one shared bus (A admin + B + C), no pod / no browser / no relay:
 *   - the sealed circle is established through the producer; A seals content B and C both read;
 *   - A removes C via the REAL op → the control agent rotates + the sink fans the v2 key-event to B ALONE;
 *   - A seals NEW content under the new version → B (remaining) reads it, C canNOT (backward secrecy: C never
 *     received the rotation key-event, so its folded chain lacks the new version);
 *   - C still reads the PRE-removal content it was entitled to (removal denies the future, not the past).
