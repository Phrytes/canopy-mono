/**
 * basis — node-level, in-process NO-POD GROUP-KEY ROTATION (self-distributing key-events in the log).
 *
 * The gap this closes: today the shared-pod control-agent rotates the group key on a membership change, but the
 * NO-POD fan-out path drops a removed member from routing WITHOUT rotating the content key — so a removed member
 * keeps a working key. Here the group key + its rotations ride the durable membership LOG as key-events (each
 * sealed multi-recipient to the then-current members' stable sealing keys); a member folds the key-events it has
 * back into the key chain and reads exactly the versions it is entitled to. A leave/remove emits a rotation
 * key-event fanned to the REMAINING members only — the departed, absent from it, cannot fold the new version in.
 *
 * Proven over THREE REAL `createRealHouseholdAgent()` instances on ONE shared `InternalBus` (the pairRealAgents
 * pattern) — A (admin) + B + C, a genuine circle join, real sealing openers derived from each agent's identity,
 * key-events + sealed content fanned over the real transport with real hold-forward. NO pod, NO browser, NO
 * relay/NKN — seconds, deterministic.
 *
 * Asserts:
 *   - A seals content C can read (both are current members) — no pod involved;
 *   - A removes C and rotates; A seals NEW content under the new version → B (remaining) reads it, C canNOT
 *     (backward secrecy: C never receives the rotation key-event, so its chain lacks the new version);
 *   - C still reads the PRE-removal content it was entitled to (removal denies the future, not the past);
 *   - a member (B) OFFLINE during the rotation catches the key-event up on reconnect (real presence-flush) and
 *     then decrypts everything it is entitled to.
