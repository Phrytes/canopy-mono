/**
 * basis v2 — member-card projections (LEDEN tab → persona card + self-view).
 *
 * Two thin projections the LEDEN (members) tab taps into, both PURE and both
 * reusing the already-built machinery — no new visibility logic lives here:
 *
 *   • member-persona — tap a member row → what THIS viewer (me) may see of THAT
 *     member: `splitViewAsAttributes` (viewAsAttributes.js) run with viewer = me
 *     over the member's attributes.
 *   • self-view — tap your own row → "how others see me": pick a viewer kind
 *     (member / stranger / agent, per `VIEWER_KINDS` in circleViewAs.js) and the
 *     `{sees, hides}` split re-runs the same reveal rules over MY attributes.
 *
 * ── Re-homed onto the C7 reveal-state (Phase 4 Wave B) ──────────────────────
 * The one reveal-state home is `disclosure.js` (`@onderling/agent-registry`): a
 * per-(context, key) `{enabled, …}` policy, default-withhold, PLUS the amount
 * presets `handle → profile → full` (`REVEAL_PRESETS`). These cards now express
 * their result as that unified reveal-state and READ it back through
 * `isDisclosed`/`revealPresetOf` — the sees/hides split is driven by the
 * `enabled` axis, and each card SURFACES the amount preset it lands at. No
 * bespoke reveal truth lives here anymore; the presets are named by AMOUNT
 * (never a field name, never "verified"/identity).
 *
 * Disclosure is per-CIRCLE (context = the circle). Today the roster carries two
 * persona attributes — the handle (the pseudonym FLOOR, always shown) and the
 * real name (the presented self). We map them onto the preset tiers via
 * `personaPresetKeys` and let `revealPresetOf` name the amount.
 *
 * ── TWO LAYERS: member-disclosure AND viewer-entitlement ───────────────────
 * A viewer sees an attribute iff (a) the MEMBER disclosed it for this circle AND
 * (b) the VIEWER is entitled to it. Layer (a) is the member's per-circle
 * reveal-state — the `Peer.revealState` disclosure policy the Peer-façade now
 * populates (`packages/core/src/discovery/peerFacade.js`); the card reads it via
 * `isDisclosed(revealState, circleId, key)`. Layer (b) is the view-as gate
 * (`splitViewAsAttributes` — viewer kind / pairwise reveal / circle policy), which
 * still runs on top. When a card is handed a raw roster row rather than a Peer, it
 * derives the SAME member-disclosure policy locally via `memberRevealState`, so
 * behaviour is identical either way. `matchable`/`requestable` are OTHER axes and
 * never touch the reveal card.
