/**
 * 5.9c — formatter for the passive local-network "who's here" row on
 * the v2 circle launcher.  Lives in /core so vitest (which excludes
 * src/screens/**, no JSX loader) can cover it without a RN test
 * renderer.  CircleLauncherScreen consumes the named export and pairs
 * it with `bundle.mdns.connectionCount`.
 *
 * Renders: `<label>: <count> device(s)`  e.g.  "Nearby: 3 device(s)".
 * Zero-state is rendered honestly ("Nearby: 0 device(s)") — that's the
 * "mDNS is live but nobody is in earshot yet" signal.  Hide-vs-show is
 * decided one level up (by whether `bundle.mdns` exists at all).
 *
 * Defensive against non-finite / negative counts (treats them as 0).
