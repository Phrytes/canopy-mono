# Track A — Pod substrate

| | |
|---|---|
| **Status** | in-progress |
| **Started** | 2026-04-28 |
| **Last updated** | 2026-04-28 |
| **Owner** | unassigned |
| **Blocked on** | nothing — ready to start |

**Goal:** make `SolidPodSource` and `SolidVault` real, then
build the pod-client SDK on top.  Foundation for everything
pod-related; A1 is the single most load-bearing task in the
whole plan.

**Refs:**
- [`../Design-v3/topology-implementation.md` §Track A](../Design-v3/topology-implementation.md#track-a--pod-substrate)
- [`../Design-v3/identity-pod-schema.md`](../Design-v3/identity-pod-schema.md) — consumers of `client.read`/`write`
- [`../Design-v3/pod-client-api.md`](../Design-v3/pod-client-api.md) — the contract A5–A7 implement
- [`../Design-v3/topology.md`](../Design-v3/topology.md) — architectural map

## Track-level open questions

Decide before the relevant task starts.  Update with the
answer when locked.

| # | Question | Answer (when known) |
|---|---|---|
| Q-A.1 | Pod-storage convention threshold (default: 1 MB? 4 MB?) | TBD before A3 |
| Q-A.2 | Default external store for `writeWithConvention` v1 (`none` / S3 / etc.) | TBD before A3 |
| Q-A.3 | Tombstone-storage adapter default: IndexedDB on web, AsyncStorage on RN, file on Node | TBD before A6 — defaults likely fine |
| Q-A.4 | Append-on-conflict retry count (default: 3) | TBD before A7 |
| Q-A.5 | ~~Whether to ship `client.patch` (n3 patch) in v1 or defer~~ | **Locked: ship in v1** |
| Q-A.6 | ~~Encryption-by-ACL key derivation~~ | **Dropped: convention removed for general user data** |

## Internal parallelism

```
A1 ──┐
A2 ──┼── A5 ── A6
A4 ──┘    └─── A7
A3 ── (independent of A5)
```

- **A1, A2, A4 are independent.**  Up to three devs can split
  from day one.
- **A3 depends on A1 only** (needs read/write working).  Can
  run in parallel with A2/A4/A5.
- **A5 needs A1 + A2 + A4** (storage + auth + token class).
- **A6 and A7 are layered onto A5** but are mostly independent
  of each other; can be interleaved.
- A team of 1: linear A1 → A2 → A4 → A3 → A5 → A6 → A7.
- A team of 2: dev1 = A1 → A3 → A5 → A6/A7; dev2 = A2 → A4.
- A team of 3: dev1 = A1 → A3; dev2 = A2; dev3 = A4 → A5 → A6/A7.

## Hand-off triggers

| When this completes | These tracks unblock |
|---|---|
| **A1** | Tracks B (identity sync), C (recovery — pod export part), H1/H2 (apps) start being possible (still need other things) |
| **A2** | Anything needing OIDC auth (e.g. `H6 import bridge`) |
| **A5** | Apps can be developed against the pod-client API; full Track H becomes practical |
| **A6 + A7** | Apps can ship with conflict UX + delete-scope UX |

## Tasks

### A1 — Implement `SolidPodSource`

| | |
|---|---|
| **Status** | done |
| **Tag** | [REPLACES STUB] |
| **Notes** | Single most load-bearing task. Inrupt locked. |

**Files:**

```
modify:
  packages/core/package.json                              # add @inrupt/solid-client dep
  packages/core/src/storage/SolidPodSource.js              # replace stub
  packages/core/src/storage/index.js                       # confirm export

tests (create):
  packages/core/test/storage/SolidPodSource.unit.test.js   # mocked HTTP
  packages/core/test/storage/SolidPodSource.css.test.js    # against running CSS instance, gated by env var
```

**Sequence:**

- [x] 1. Add `@inrupt/solid-client` to `packages/core/package.json` dependencies. Pin a current stable version. Run `npm install` from the monorepo root.
- [x] 2. Sketch the public API of `SolidPodSource` matching the existing `DataSource.js` interface (read / write / list / delete / exists).
- [x] 3. Replace `NOT_IMPLEMENTED` stub with real implementation:
  - [x] `read(uri, opts)` — `getFile(uri, { fetch })`, return `{ content, contentType, lastModified, etag, size }`.
  - [x] `write(uri, content, opts)` — `overwriteFile(uri, blob, { contentType, fetch })`. Honor `If-Match` for conflict detection.
  - [x] `list(containerUri, opts)` — `getSolidDataset(containerUri, { fetch })` + `getContainedResourceUrlAll`. Return `entries` per spec.
  - [x] `delete(uri, opts)` — `deleteFile(uri, { fetch })`. Honor `If-Match`.
  - [x] `exists(uri)` — HEAD via fetch.
- [x] 4. Map Inrupt errors to the project's error taxonomy (`NotFoundError`, `AuthError`, etc. — see [`pod-client-api.md` §Error model](../Design-v3/pod-client-api.md#error-model)). The errors live in `pod-client` (Track A5); for now `SolidPodSource` can throw plain `Error` with a `code` field that A5 maps later.
- [x] 5. Constructor accepts an optional `fetch` function (so `SolidVault`'s authenticated fetch can be plugged in by callers).
- [x] 6. Write **unit tests** with mocked fetch — happy path + 404 + 401 + 412 + 500.
- [x] 7. Write **integration tests** against a local Community Solid Server: `npm run test:css` (gated by env var, skip in CI for now).
- [x] 8. Update `packages/core/src/storage/index.js` to export the working class. Smoke-test from the monorepo root.

**DoD:**
- No remaining `NOT_IMPLEMENTED` throws.
- Unit tests green.
- CSS integration tests pass locally.
- A simple round-trip script (`scripts/podsource-smoke.js` if useful) reads + writes a `.txt` resource against a CSS pod successfully.
- `Mnemonic.js` and other existing tests still green.

**Notes (team scratchpad):**

```
2026-04-28 (agent):
- Pinned @inrupt/solid-client at 3.0.0 (current latest stable on npm at
  the time of install).
- No `packages/core/src/storage/index.js` barrel exists; storage classes
  are exported from `packages/core/src/index.js` directly.  That export
  was already wired (line 136), no change needed.
- `read()` returns the rich object `{ content, contentType, lastModified,
  etag, size }` per the pod-client spec — divergent from
  `DataSource.read()`'s `Buffer|string|null` shape.  Documented in the
  class JSDoc; consumers who only want bytes pull `.content`.
- Error taxonomy: NOT_FOUND / UNAUTHORIZED / FORBIDDEN / CONFLICT /
  RATE_LIMITED / SERVER_ERROR / NETWORK_ERROR / INVALID_ARGUMENT /
  HTTP_ERROR.  A5's `Errors.js` will map these onto PodClientError
  subclasses.
- `If-Match` path: Inrupt's `overwriteFile` doesn't surface request-init,
  so when ifMatch is provided we drop to a manual PUT through the same
  `fetch` we were given.  Same story for delete-with-ifMatch.
- HEAD-after-Inrupt-success: Inrupt buries response headers, so etag /
  lastModified are recovered via a follow-up HEAD.  Best-effort — failure
  here doesn't fail the read/write.
- Constructor still accepts the legacy `credential` field for backwards
  compat (ignored).  Preferred shape is `{ podUrl, fetch }`.
- Did NOT implement `query()` — Solid LDP has no equivalent of "structured
  field-match across all resources".  Throws INVALID_ARGUMENT with a clear
  message.
- CSS integration tests: gate on `process.env.CSS_URL`.  Optional auth via
  `CSS_FETCH_AUTH_HEADER`.  Scratch container path overridable via
  `CSS_SCRATCH` (default `scratch/`).  Did not write `scripts/start-css.sh`
  yet — that's a separate concern (mentioned in the test infra section).
- Existing storage.test.js's NOT_IMPLEMENTED assertion was replaced with
  a smoke test (constructor + method-existence + query-throws).

### A2 — Implement `SolidVault` (Solid OIDC)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Status** | not-started |
| **Tag** | [REPLACES STUB] |
| **Notes** | Independent of A1 — can be done in parallel. |

**Files:**

```
modify:
  packages/core/package.json                              # add @inrupt/solid-client-authn-node + browser counterpart
  packages/core/src/storage/SolidVault.js                  # replace stub

tests (create):
  packages/core/test/storage/SolidVault.unit.test.js       # mocked OIDC
  packages/core/test/storage/SolidVault.css.test.js        # against running CSS, gated by env var
```

**Sequence:**

- [ ] 1. Add `@inrupt/solid-client-authn-node` to `packages/core/package.json`. Browser variant (`@inrupt/solid-client-authn-browser`) goes into `packages/react-native/package.json` later (Track B); for now Node-only is fine.
- [ ] 2. Public API:
  - [ ] `constructor({ webid, oidcIssuer?, redirectUrl?, vault? })` — `vault` is the existing `Vault` instance for token storage.
  - [ ] `login(opts)` — performs OIDC flow. For Node, token-issuer-based; for browser/RN, redirect-based (RN wiring is Track B).
  - [ ] `logout()` — invalidate tokens, clear vault entries.
  - [ ] `isAuthenticated()` — bool.
  - [ ] `getAuthenticatedFetch()` — returns a `fetch` function bound to the session, suitable for `SolidPodSource`'s constructor.
  - [ ] `refresh()` — refresh tokens; emit `'auth-state'` event.
  - [ ] `podRoot` getter — derived from WebID profile.
- [ ] 3. Token storage in `Vault` under namespace `solid-oidc:<webid>`. Keys: `access_token`, `refresh_token`, `expires_at`, `id_token`.
- [ ] 4. Implement automatic refresh when access token within 60s of expiry.
- [ ] 5. Unit tests with mocked OIDC server — login flow, refresh, logout, expired-without-refresh.
- [ ] 6. CSS integration test — actually log in to a CSS instance, write + read a resource through `SolidPodSource` using the vault's authenticated fetch.

**DoD:**
- No remaining `NOT_IMPLEMENTED` throws.
- `SolidPodSource(podRoot, { fetch: vault.getAuthenticatedFetch() })` works against a real CSS pod.
- Tokens persist across process restarts (refresh-token honored).
- Unit + integration tests green.

### A3 — Pod-storage convention bind

| | |
|---|---|
| **Status** | not-started |
| **Tag** | [NEW] |
| **Notes** | Depends on A1.  Decide Q-A.1 + Q-A.2 first. |

**Files:**

```
create:
  packages/core/src/storage/PodStorageConvention.js
  packages/core/src/storage/external-stores/index.js       # adapter pattern
  packages/core/src/storage/external-stores/NoneStore.js   # default no-op
  packages/core/src/storage/reference-manifest.js          # schema + parser

tests (create):
  packages/core/test/storage/PodStorageConvention.test.js
  packages/core/test/storage/reference-manifest.test.js
```

**Sequence:**

- [ ] 1. Lock Q-A.1 (threshold) and Q-A.2 (default external store).
- [ ] 2. Define the reference-manifest JSON shape per [`pod-client-api.md` §writeWithConvention](../Design-v3/pod-client-api.md#writewithconventionclient-uri-content-opts):
  ```json
  { "$type": "external-reference", "uri": "...", "contentType": "...", "size": ..., "hash": "sha256:..." }
  ```
- [ ] 3. Implement `writeWithConvention(podSource, externalStore, uri, content, opts)`:
  - if `content.size <= threshold` → write inline via `podSource.write(uri, content)`.
  - else → upload to `externalStore`, write reference manifest at `uri` instead.
- [ ] 4. Implement `readWithConvention(podSource, externalStore, uri)`:
  - read via `podSource.read(uri)`.
  - if content is reference manifest → fetch from `externalStore`, return as if inline.
  - if not → return as-is.
- [ ] 5. `ExternalStore` interface: `put(blob, opts) → uri`, `get(uri) → blob`, `delete(uri)`, `exists(uri)`.
- [ ] 6. Ship `NoneStore` as the v1 default — throws if asked to put/get. Forces explicit opt-in for big content.
- [ ] 7. Unit tests covering small content, big content, reference parsing, hash mismatch detection.

**DoD:**
- Round-trip a 500 KB file (inline) and a 5 MB file (referenced via a mock external store) through the helpers.
- Hash-mismatch on read raises a typed error.
- Tests green.

### A4 — `PodCapabilityToken`

| | |
|---|---|
| **Status** | not-started |
| **Tag** | [NEW] |
| **Notes** | Independent of A1 / A2 / A3 — fully parallelizable.  Mirrors existing `CapabilityToken.js` shape; pod-resource scopes instead of agent-skill auth. |

**Files:**

```
create:
  packages/core/src/permissions/PodCapabilityToken.js
  packages/core/test/permissions/PodCapabilityToken.test.js

modify:
  packages/core/src/permissions/index.js                 # export PodCapabilityToken
```

**Refs:** [`pod-client-api.md` §PodCapabilityToken](../Design-v3/pod-client-api.md#podcapabilitytoken) for the canonical wire format and scope syntax.

**Sequence:**

- [ ] 1. Read existing `packages/core/src/permissions/CapabilityToken.js` carefully — `PodCapabilityToken` mirrors its shape with two differences: `agentId` → `pod` (pod root URI) and `skill` → `scopes` (array of scope strings).
- [ ] 2. Implement constructor + getters matching the spec wire format (`id`, `issuer`, `subject`, `pod`, `scopes`, `constraints?`, `issuedAt`, `expiresAt`, `parentId?`, `sig`).
- [ ] 3. Implement `static async issue(identity, opts)` mirroring `CapabilityToken.issue`.
- [ ] 4. Implement `static async verify(token)` — verifies signature against `issuer` pubKey.
- [ ] 5. Implement `static async verifyChain(token, allTokens)` — chain attenuation (parent's scopes must be supersets, parent's expiry must be ≥ child's).
- [ ] 6. Implement `matchesScope(scope, requiredScope)` — prefix-strict scope matching per [`pod-client-api.md`](../Design-v3/pod-client-api.md#podcapabilitytoken).  Test cases:
  - [ ] `pod.read:/notes/` matches `pod.read:/notes/foo.md` ✓
  - [ ] `pod.read:/notes/` does NOT match `pod.read:/photos/` ✗
  - [ ] `pod.*:/notes/` matches `pod.read:/notes/foo.md` ✓ and `pod.write:/notes/foo.md` ✓
- [ ] 7. Tests: issue / verify / chain / scope matching / expiry / signature failure.

**DoD:**
- Class works in isolation (no pod / no SolidPodSource needed).
- Tests cover issue / verify / chain attenuation / scope matching.
- Exported from `packages/core/src/permissions/index.js`.
- Existing `CapabilityToken.js` untouched — they coexist.

### A5 — Pod-client high-level API (`@canopy/pod-client`)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Status** | not-started |
| **Tag** | [NEW] |
| **Notes** | Depends on A1 + A2 + A4.  Implements the [`pod-client-api.md`](../Design-v3/pod-client-api.md) spec. |

**Files:**

```
create:
  packages/pod-client/package.json
  packages/pod-client/src/PodClient.js
  packages/pod-client/src/Auth/Auth.js                  # interface only
  packages/pod-client/src/Auth/CapabilityAuth.js
  packages/pod-client/src/Auth/SolidOidcAuth.js
  packages/pod-client/src/Errors.js
  packages/pod-client/src/index.js
  packages/pod-client/test/PodClient.test.js
  packages/pod-client/test/Auth.test.js

modify:
  package.json                                          # add packages/pod-client to workspace
  packages/core/package.json                            # depend on @canopy/pod-client (later — when core consumers migrate)
```

**Sequence:**

- [ ] 1. Create the new package skeleton — `package.json` with `"name": "@canopy/pod-client"`, `"type": "module"`, `vitest` dev dep, `@canopy/core` dep.
- [ ] 2. Add to root workspace.
- [ ] 3. Implement `Errors.js` per [`pod-client-api.md` §Error model](../Design-v3/pod-client-api.md#error-model). All errors extend `PodClientError`.
- [ ] 4. Implement `Auth.js` interface (no implementation, just JSDoc).
- [ ] 5. Implement `CapabilityAuth.js` — wraps a capability token, presents as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (mode `'pod-direct'` only in v1).
- [ ] 6. Implement `SolidOidcAuth.js` — wraps a `SolidVault` instance; delegates `getAuthHeaders` to vault's authenticated-fetch sample request.
- [ ] 7. Implement `PodClient.js` core methods (`read`, `list`, `write`, `append`) by delegating to a `SolidPodSource` constructed with the auth's authenticated fetch.
- [ ] 8. Map `SolidPodSource` errors to `PodClientError` subtypes.
- [ ] 9. Unit tests for each method against a mocked `SolidPodSource`.
- [ ] 10. Integration test: full flow with a real CSS instance + a test capability token (issued via existing `CapabilityToken.issue`).

**DoD:**
- `PodClient` round-trips read/write/list/append against CSS using both `CapabilityAuth` and `SolidOidcAuth`.
- All errors typed per the spec.
- Tests green.

### A6 — Delete-scope primitive

| | |
|---|---|
| **Status** | not-started |
| **Tag** | [NEW] |
| **Notes** | Depends on A5. |

**Files:**

```
create:
  packages/pod-client/src/TombstoneStore.js          # storage adapter pattern
  packages/pod-client/src/tombstones/IndexedDBTombstones.js
  packages/pod-client/src/tombstones/AsyncStorageTombstones.js   # RN
  packages/pod-client/src/tombstones/FileTombstones.js            # Node fallback
  packages/pod-client/test/deleteScope.test.js

modify:
  packages/pod-client/src/PodClient.js                # add deleteLocal, deleteCompletely, clearTombstone
```

**Sequence:**

- [ ] 1. `TombstoneStore` interface: `add(uri)`, `has(uri)`, `remove(uri)`, `list()`.
- [ ] 2. Implement three adapters per Q-A.3 defaults.
- [ ] 3. `client.deleteLocal(uri)` → `tombstoneStore.add(uri)`. Pod is not touched.
- [ ] 4. `client.deleteCompletely(uri)` → `podSource.delete(uri)`. On success, remove any existing tombstone (no longer relevant).
- [ ] 5. `client.list(...)` filters out tombstoned URIs unless `opts.includeTombstoned`.
- [ ] 6. `client.clearTombstone(uri)` for "I changed my mind."
- [ ] 7. Tests: delete-locally then list (tombstoned filtered); delete-completely (gone from pod); clear-tombstone (re-appears).

**DoD:**
- Both delete modes work with explicit semantics.
- Tombstone state survives a `PodClient` restart (storage adapter persists).

### A7 — Conflict detection + resolution

| | |
|---|---|
| **Status** | not-started |
| **Tag** | [NEW] |
| **Notes** | Depends on A5. |

**Files:**

```
create:
  packages/pod-client/src/ConflictResolver.js
  packages/pod-client/test/conflict.test.js

modify:
  packages/pod-client/src/PodClient.js                # wire If-Match + 412 handling + 'conflict' event
```

**Sequence:**

- [ ] 1. Per-resource last-known etag/lastModified state inside `PodClient` (in-memory map keyed by URI; persists across calls within the lifetime of the client).
- [ ] 2. On every `read`, capture etag/lastModified.
- [ ] 3. On every `write` / `delete` / `append`, send `If-Match` with the last-known value (unless `force: true`).
- [ ] 4. On HTTP 412 from the pod, emit `'conflict'` event with both versions per [`pod-client-api.md` §Conflict detection](../Design-v3/pod-client-api.md#conflict-detection).
- [ ] 5. Implement the four conflict policies: `lww`, `remote-wins`, `reject`, listener-driven. Default per call: `lww`.
- [ ] 6. `event.resolveWith(content)` re-issues the write with `force: true` and the resolved content.
- [ ] 7. `event.cancelWrite()` aborts; promise rejects with `ConflictError`.
- [ ] 8. Append retry: read-modify-write loop with up to N retries (Q-A.4); raise `ConflictError` if exhausted.
- [ ] 9. Tests: simulate concurrent writes (two `PodClient` instances against the same CSS pod), verify each policy.

**DoD:**
- Concurrent-write scenario surfaces a 'conflict' event with expected payloads.
- All four policies work.
- Append retry exhausts to `ConflictError` on hostile contention.

## Test infrastructure

A real Community Solid Server instance is needed for
integration tests. Options:

- **Docker:** `docker run -p 3000:3000 solidproject/community-server` — simplest.
- **npm:** `npx @solid/community-server` — alternative.

Suggest adding to the monorepo:
- `scripts/start-css.sh` — start a fresh CSS for tests.
- `scripts/stop-css.sh` — clean up.
- `vitest` config: a `test:css` script that requires `CSS_URL` env var.

CI strategy: run unit tests always; run CSS integration tests
in a separate job with CSS docker side-car.
